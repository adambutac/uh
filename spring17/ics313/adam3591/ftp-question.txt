FTP Question: File transfer (15 points) Why are there 2 file transfer modes provided by ftp and sftp? 
  note: the answer is NOT secure vs. non-secure i.e. NOT ftp vs. sftp. 

  Ascii mode allows the transfer of text files.
  Binary mode allows the transfer of arbitrary types of files.
  
How do you select the correct mode for each file type? 

  In the FileZilla client, it is in the Transfer menu as Transfer Type.

What happens if a file in transferred in the wrong mode? 

  Ascii bytes always have a zero as the most significant bit. Transferring files in ASCII mode that are not text files will most likely cause loss of data.
