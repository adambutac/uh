INTRODUCTION:

  CURSEON is a ultra-lite text based rpg.  You play the role of a wanderer who
is trapped in the relm of the *rip-van-winkle* wizard Curseon.  Can you find a
way out of Curesons world? Or will your stack be doomed to overflow?

INSTALLATION:

  Installation is easy! All you need is a copy of CLISP on your device.
  To star the game, type "clisp curseon.lisp".

GAMEPLAY:

  As with most text based games, the player enters commands to explore the
world by walking, looking, etc.  The help command lists all the possible
commands that the game will accept.  However, it is up to you to find out
how to use these commands to free yourself.
