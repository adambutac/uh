Solution 1:
  balls of the same color are unique
    total number of permutations - subset of permutations where two balls of the same color touch
                                  (assume same colors are touching, 3 colors of balls, 3 distinct elements)
    5! - 3! = 114

  balls of the same color are indistinquishable
    5 * 2 * 1 = 10

Solution 2:
  balls of the same color are unique
  ???
  balls of the same color are indistinquishable
  ???

Solution 3:
  balls of the same color are unique
  ???
  balls of the same color are indistinquishable
  ???
