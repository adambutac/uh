A society is an association of people organized under a system of rules designed to advance the good of its members over time [2]. Cooperation among individuals helps promote the common good. However, people in a society also compete with each other; for example, when deciding how to divide limited benefits among themselves. Sometimes the competition is relatively trivial, such as when many people vie for tickets to a movie premiere. At other times the competition is much more significant, such as when two start-up companies seek control of an emerging market.

Every society has rules of conduct describing what people ought and ought not to do in various situations. We call these rules morality.

Ethics is the philosophical study of morality, a rational examination into peopleâ€™s moral beliefs and behavior.
