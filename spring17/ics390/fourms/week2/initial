1. Pick a technology from the reading and explain why you believe it was the most influential in our technological advances throughout time.

	After reading the chapter I feel that the technology most influential in our techological advances would be the semiconductor.  Mores specifically, transistors and integrated circuits.  At this point in our careers as students, we have all heard of Moores Law at least several times.  The invention of the transistor is what drove the cost of electronics down since transistors were cheaper to make, and were generally an improvement over the vacuum tube.  It is also what lead to the invention of integrated circuits which then simplified circutry even further by combining common circuits into modules.  This eventually lead to the invention of the first microprocessors, and eventually the personal computer.  

2. Choose a modern technology that you frequently use and describe the pros and cons you experience with it.

	One modern technology that I currently use is the search engine, or what most people would probably regard as "the internet". I would guess that at least 50% of the information that I pull from the internet starts at the search engine.  To me, it is such a convenient tool that it has become vital.  Without it I would probably spend most of my time searching for answers through books and other offline resources and my productivity would suffer.  On the other hand, because I have become so relient on my prosthetic knowledge I am much less productive without an internet connection. Just as those fear being without a cellphone, I fear being caught in the wild without a search engine and a good internet connection.  *insert-favorite-search-engine-here* has all the answers, I just know the questions.
