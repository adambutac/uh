What do you fear most about public speaking opportunities?
    After much reflection I have come to the conclusion most of us have; the greatest fear caused by public speaking is the fear of failure and/or humiliation.  EVen though I understand that "none of us are perfect" and that "we all make mistakes," I still find it extremely difficult to deliver a presentation simply because I am afraid of screwing up.  What I find most frustrating is that dwelling on the anxiety of presenting in front of an audience is the cause of all my mistakes.  I believe that fear stems from being uncomfortable or unsure of something, and my hope is that by exercising my (lack of) public speaking skills I will become more confident in my ability to speak.

Think of someone you admire as a public speaker. What qualities and skills does this person possess and use to be a good communicator?
    I admire (most of) my teachers as public speakers. There is no apparent difference when they speak in front of one student, or a hundred students.  They are calm and can speak with clarity both in their voice and in their minds.  If they stumble, they simply start where they left off, take a small pause, or use some other tactic to diffuse the situation and aren't "awkward about it."  They have an exuberant understanding of the material they are presenting and can sometimes even share their enthusiasm with the class. 

What new aspects of plagiarism did you learn from the tutorial and the readings from the text? Did anything surprise you?
    I find it interesting that even if it is unintentional, it is still considered plagiarism.  What happens if someone unknowingly cites plagiarised material? 

Did your thoughts about plagiarism change? How so?
    I think my ideas of plagiarism are still the same.
