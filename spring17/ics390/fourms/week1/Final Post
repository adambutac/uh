•Did your perceptions of public speaking change? How so? If not, what concerns do you still have?

	My superficial theory on public speaking is that the opinion of others matters to us because it directly effects how others will interact with me.  I feel that our fear was developed out of necessity, designed to be used as a motivation to better ourselves.  Discussing the fears of public speaking in class helped me better connect with my peers.  It was comforting to know that in some form, we all share the same concerns.  However, my perception of public speaking has not changed.  For me, sharing only validated that our fears are real and substantive, even if the underlying reasons are not fully understood.  Also I'm not so sure if understanding fear and conquering it are the same thing.  

•Based on the course you are assisting, what types of ARCS strategies do you see being beneficial to your week of teaching?
	In order to capture their attention, my week of teaching will include demonstration(s) that the students will be able to conduct themselves as they follow along to capture their attention.  The demonstration(s) will be something meaningful, interesting, and relatable, that the students fully understand, and that can be used and extended outside of class if they so choose to.

•How do you plan to manage your time in this course?
	I used the option in STAR registration to import my classes into my google calendar.  From there I added crutial times such as work and sleep, and events where I can multitask such as traveling on the bus. I then alloted sections of time where I am able to dedicate my attention to my coursework.  I am not completely sure if I will be completely dedicated to the schedule, but its a start.
