Body

  Income and Wealth
    pro
      Everyone is given a fair share of wealth, and if there is enough to go 
      around then there is no poverty.  Since everyone has an equal amount
      of money, no one has an advantage over anyone else.
    con
      Wealth is distributed evenly regardless of who earns the most. If one 
      works twice as hard as another, or if one works half as much as someone 
      else, they all get paid equally. 
    
  Resources
    pros
      Land and other external material goods are distributed evenly.  It can 
      even include things needed for ones business such as tools. Or even 
      supplying a wheelchair to someone who cannot walk.
    cons
      It is very difficult to quantify equality in this way.
    
  Welfare
    pro
      Everyone is entitled to the same amount of happiness.
    con
      Some people are worse off by nature, for example someone who is 
      disabled.

In “The Critique of the Gotha Program,” Marx asserts that in the first phase
 of communist society the economy will distribute goods according to the 
norm, to each according to his labor contribution. This norm can be regarded
 as defining an equal right, but like any such right, it is defective. One 
defect is that some individuals are naturally more able than others, and so 
the amount of one's labor contribution will vary depending on factors that 
vary by luck beyond one's power to control. (plato.stanford.edu)
