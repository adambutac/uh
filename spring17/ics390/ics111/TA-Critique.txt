Introduction
After eight weeks of carefully observing teaching assistant Nurit Kirshenbaum, I can say that her abilities as a T.A. are great and that I admire her ability to conduct the labs.  With that said, I believe that there is always room for further improvement.
Organization
Kirshenbaum splits class time into several sections in the following order: quiz taking, quiz reviewing, a programming exercise, and finally homework reviewing.
Confidence
Kirschenbaum displays confidence in herself and her ability to teach, but does she instill confidence within the students?  I feel like she tries to, but the students are generally unempathetic.
Relevance
    Quizzes always cover the concepts of the week as stated on the class syllabus.  The students often complain that they are too difficult and recently they successfully petitioned more time to be given for them.  It should be noted that Kirschenbaum only makes a portion of the total quizzes to be taken during the semester.

The concepts covered in the class exercises can always be directly applied to the current homework assignments.
Attention
Kirschenbaum lacks enthusiasm for the material and I feel that is reflected in the students.
Kirschenbaum has difficulties connecting and energizing students during lab.
