So I'm about to make my new ICS smartfolio, portsmolio... techfolio.
Right, techfolio.

I'm already unsure of where to begin, but I haven't really started yet so not
sure why I'm already complaining.  Seems like something you pull, and then
push to your own repo? Will be back soon.

Found info on how to make the techfolio, initial assumption was correct.
You pull the techfolio boiler plate, then edit the files to your liking.
Once youre satisfied, you push to your own github.io site. Having the ability
to view changes locally would be good because sometimes we like to work
without an internet connection. Being able to view changes on the fly would be
great.

User Guide

At this point, I've gotten tired of following the guide step by step, and
have moved on to editing the bio.js file which I found to be relatively
painless.  One thing I did notice is that updates to the files in the repo
take some time to appear on the site, which is slightly annoying.

I've been working for a while now, so I will come back to this hopefully
tomorrow.
