Please create and/or update your TechFolio this week (Create a new project, write a simple essay, update something there).
Use this as an opportunity to discover "pain points" around creation/maintenance of techfolios.
Refer to ics-portfolios.github.io for examples if you're doing this for the first time.
Write an essay that discusses your personal experience with TechFolio and how a desktop client could help. (If you want, you can provide background on Electron and/or your hopes for this summer project.)
Please start creating an electron app.
Create your own repo in techfolios organization. Call it electron-<your first name>.
We will review this next Monday at 1pm.
When you have something of interest to show, please post to #electron-intro. Please post both a link to your electron repo as well as a link to your techfolio by this Friday.
