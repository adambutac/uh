                     Homework Assignment #7

Exercise #1
    Question #1 (10)
        Given that,
        p = # of processors
        f = percentage of enhanceable code = 80% = 0.8
        Speedup(p) = 1/(1-f + f/p)
        Efficency(p) = Speedup(p)/p = 50% = 0.5

        We can conclude the following
        
        E(p) = S(p)/p = 1/2

        p/2 = S(p) = 1/(1-f + f/p)
        2/p = 1 - f + f/p
        2 = p(1-f) + f
        2/(1-f) = p + f/(1-f)
        p = 2/(1-f) - f/(1-f) 
        p = (2 - f)/(1 - f)
        p = (2 - 0.8)/(1 - 0.8)
        therefore
        p = 1.2/0.2 = 6

    Question #2 (10)

        Since we know, when f is the percentage of enhanceable
        code, Speedup(p) = 1/(1 - f + f/p), and we are given
        p = 12, Speedup(12) = 10 

        Solving for f...
        
        10 = 1/(1 - f + f/12)
        1/10 = 1 - f + f/12        
        1/10 = 12/12 - 12f/12 + 1f/12
        1/10 = 1 - 13f/12
        13f/12 = 9/10
        therefore
        f = (9/10)(12/13) = 83.08%

   Question #3 (10)

        Given that,
        f = 95%
        A machine with 10 cores...
        A machine with 16 cores that runs 75% slower...
        t inital = 1min

        Calculating the initial speedup(10) = 6.89655
        and so the sequential time T = 6.89655 minutes
        This means that the 16 core machine would take
        6.89655 * 1.25 minutes = 8.571428 minutes.
        Calculating the 16 core speedup(16) = 9.1428
        
        We know that Speedup(p) = T/T'
        So that 9.1428 = 8.5714/T'

        solving for T'...

        T' = 0.9375 minutes < 1 minute
