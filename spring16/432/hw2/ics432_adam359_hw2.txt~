                     Homework Assignment #2

Exercise #1

    Solution #1

    Thread #1 enters the barrier
    Thread #1 aquires lock A
    Thread #1 releases lock B
    Thread #1 exits the barrier
    Thread #2 arrives 

    Solution #2

    Thread #2 enters the barrier
    Thread #2 releases lock A
    Thread #2 locks B
    Thread #2 exits the barrier 
    Thread #1 arrives

    Solution #3

    Thread #1 enters the barrier
    Thread #1 unlocks A
    Thread #1 locks B
    Thread #1 exits the barrier
    Thread #2 arrives

    Solution #4

    I think this would work, but as it stands Thread #1 and #2 are deadlocked.
