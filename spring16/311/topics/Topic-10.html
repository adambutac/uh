<hr><h2> Quicksort </h2>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Motivations</h3>
<p>Quicksort, like Mergesort, takes a divide and conquer approach, but on a different basis.</p> 

<p>If we have done two comparisons among three keys and find that <i>x</i> &lt; <i>p</i> and
<i>p</i> &lt; <i>y</i>, do we ever need to compare <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>? Where do the three belong
relative to each other in the sorted array? </p>

<p>Quicksort uses this idea to partition the set of keys to be sorted into those less than the pivot
<i>p</i> and those greater than the pivot. (It can be generalized to allow keys equal to the pivot.)
It then recurses on the two partitions.</p>
<img src="Topic-10/quicksort-recursion.jpg">

<p>Compare this to Mergesort.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both take a recursive divide-and-conquer approach.</li>
  <li>Mergesort does its work on the way back up the recursion tree (merging), while Quicksort does
      its work on the way down the recursion tree (partitioning).</li>
  <li>Mergesort always partitions in half; for Quicksort the size of the partitions depends on the
      pivot (this results in &Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) worst case behavior, but expected case
      remains &Theta;(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>).</li> 
  <li>Mergesort requires axillary arrays to copy the data; while as we shall see Quicksort can
      operate entirely within the given array: it is an <b>in-place sort</b>.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Quicksort performs well in practice, and is one of the most widely used sorts today.</p>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>The Quicksort Algorithm</h3>
<p>To sort any subarray A[<i>p</i> .. <i>r</i>], &nbsp; <i>p</i> &lt; <i>r</i>: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>Divide:</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Partition A[<i>p</i> .. <i>r</i>] into two (possibly empty) subarrays
    <ul>
      <li> A[<i>p</i> .. <i>q-1</i>], where every element is &le; A[<i>q</i>]</li>
      <li> A[<i>q + 1</i> .. <i>r</i>], where A[<i>q</i>] &le; every element</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><b><i>Conquer:</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Sort the two subarrays by recursive calls</dd>
  <dt><b><i>Combine:</i></b></dt>
  <dd>No work is needed to combine: all subarrays (including the entire array) are sorted as soon as
    recursion ends.</dd> 
</dl>
  
<p>An array is sorted with a call to <tt>QUICKSORT(A, 1, A.length)</tt>:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-quicksort.jpg">

<p>The work is done in the PARTITION procedure. A[<i>r</i>] will be the pivot. (Note that the
<em>end</em> element of the array is taken as the pivot. Given random data, the choice of the
position of the pivot is arbitrary; working with an end element simplifies the code):</p>

<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-quicksort-partition.jpg">

<p>PARTITION maintains four regions.</p>

<img src="Topic-10/Fig-7-2-partition-regions.jpg">

<p>Three of these are described by the following loop invariants,
and the fourth (A[<i>j</i> .. <i>r</i>-1]) consists of elements that not yet been examined: </p>

<blockquote>
<b>Loop Invariant:</b>
<ol>
  <li> All entries in A[<i>p</i> .. <i>i</i>] are &le; pivot.</li>
  <li> All entries in A[<i>i</i>+1 .. <i>j</i>-1] are &gt; pivot.</li>
  <li> A[<i>r</i>] = pivot.
</ol>
</blockquote>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Example Trace </h3>

<p>It is worth taking some time to trace through and explain each step of this example of the
PARTITION procedure, paying particular attention to the movement of the dark lines representing
partition boundaries. </p>

<p>Continuing ...</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDgvnbUIqT4">Hungarian Dance version of
quicksort</a>, in case that helps to make sense of it! </p>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Correctness</h3>

<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-quicksort-partition.jpg" align="right">

<p>Here use the loop invariant to show correctness:</p> 
<ol>
  <li> All entries in A[<i>p</i> .. <i>i</i>] are &le; pivot.</li>
  <li> All entries in A[<i>i</i>+1 .. <i>j</i> &minus;1] are &gt; pivot.</li>
  <li> A[<i>r</i>] = pivot.
</ol>

<dl>
  <dt><b><i>Initialization:</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Before the loop starts, <i>x</i> is assigned the pivot A[<i>r</i>] (satisfying condition 3),
    and the subarrays  a[<i>p</i> .. <i>i</i>] and A[<i>i</i>+1 .. <i>j</i>&minus;1] are empty (trivially
    satisfying conditions 1 and 2). </dd>
  <dt><b><i>Maintenance:</i></b></dt>
  <dd>While the loop is running,
    <ul>
      <li>if A[<i>j</i>] &le; pivot, then <i>i</i> is incremented, A[<i>j</i>] and A[<i>i</i>] are
          swapped, and <i>j</i> is incremented. Because of the swap, A[<i>i</i>] &le;
          <i>x</i> for condition 1. The item swapped into A[<i>j</i>-1] &gt; <i>x</i> by the loop
          invariant, for condition 2.</li>
      <li>If A[<i>j</i>] &gt; pivot, then <i>j</i> is incremented, sustaining condition 2 (the
          others are unchanged), as the element added was larger</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><b><i>Termination:</i></b></dt>
  <dd>The loop terminates when <i>j</i>=<i>r</i>, so all elements in A are partitioned into one of
    three cases: A[<i>p</i> .. <i>i</i>] &le; pivot, A[<i>i</i>+1 .. <i>r</i>-1] &gt; pivot, and
    A[<i>r</i>] = pivot. The last two lines fix the placement of A[<i>r</i>] by moving it between
    the two subarrays.</dd> 
</dl>

<hr><h2> Informal Analysis </h2>

<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-quicksort-partition.jpg" align="right">
<p>The formal analysis will be done on a randomized version of Quicksort. This informal analysis
helps to motivate that randomization.</p>

<p>First, PARTITION is &Theta;(<i>n</i>): We can easily see that its only component that grows with
<i>n</i> is the <tt>for</tt> loop that iterates proportional to the number of elements in the
subarray). </p>

<p>The runtime depends on the partitioning of the subarrays:</p> 

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Worst Case</h3>

<p>The worst case occurs when the subarrays are completely unbalanced, i.e., there are 0 elements in
one subarray and <i>n</i>-1 elements in the other subarray (the single pivot is not processed in
recursive calls). This gives a familiar recurrence (compare to that for insertion sort): </p>

<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-worst-recurrence.jpg">

<p>One example of data that leads to this behavior is when the data is already sorted: the pivot is
always the maximum element, so we get partitions of size <i>n</i>&minus;1 and 0 each time.  Thus,
<u>quicksort is O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) on sorted data</u>.  Insertion sort actually does better on
a sorted array!  (O(<i>n</i>))</p>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Best Case</h3>

<p>The best case occurs when the subarrays are completely balanced (the pivot is the median value):
subarrays have about <i>n</i>/2 elements. The reucurrence is also familiar (compare to that for
merge sort):</p>

<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-best-recurrence.jpg">

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Effect of Unbalanced Partitioning</h3>

<p>It turns out that expected behavior is closer to the best case than the worst case. Two examples
suggest why expected case won't be that bad.</p> 

<h4>Example: 1-to-9 split</h4>

<p>Suppose each call splits the data into 1/10 and 9/10. This is highly unbalanced: won't it result
in horrible performance?</p>
<img src="Topic-10/Fig-7-4-quicksort-1-9-recursion-tree.jpg">

<p>We have log<sub>10</sub><i>n</i> full levels and log<sub>10/9</sub><i>n</i> levels that are
nonempty.</p>

<p>As long as it's constant, the base of the log does not affect asymptotic results. Any
split of constant proportionality will yield a recursion tree of depth &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>). In
particular (using &asymp; to indicate truncation of low order digits),</p>

<blockquote>
  log<sub>10/9</sub><i>n</i> = (log<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>) / (log<sub>2</sub>10/9)
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>by formula  3.15</i><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &asymp;  (log<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>) / 0.152 <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 1/0.152 (log<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &asymp;  6.5788 (log<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>), where <i>c</i> =  6.5788. 
</blockquote> 

<p>So the recurrence and its solution is:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-9-1-recurrence.jpg">

<p>A general lesson that might be taken from this: sometimes, even very unbalanced divide and
conquer can be useful.</p>

<h4>Example: extreme cases cancel out</h4>

<p>With random data there will usually be a mix of good and bad splits throughout the recursion
tree.</p>

<p>A mixture of worst case and best case splits is asymptotically the same as best case: </p>

<img src="Topic-10/Fig-7-5-quicksort-unbalanced-splits.jpg">

<p>Both these trees have the same two leaves. The extra level on the left hand side only increases
the height by a factor of 2, and this constant disappears in the &Theta; analysis.</p>

<p>Both result in O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>), though with a larger constant for the left.</p> 

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Randomized Quicksort </h2>

<img src="Topic-10/no-badguy.jpg" align="right">

<p>We expect good average case behavior if all input permutations are equally likely, but what if it
is not?</p>

<p>To get better performance on sorted or nearly sorted data -- and to foil our adversary! -- we can 
randomize the algorithm to get the same effect as if the input data were random.</p> 

<p>Instead of explicitly permuting the input data (which is expensive), randomization can be
accomplished trivially by <b>random sampling</b> of one of the array elements as the pivot.</p>

<p>If we swap the selected item with the last element, the existing PARTITION procedure applies:</p>  
<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-randomized-quicksort.jpg"><br> 
<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-randomized-partition.jpg">

<p>Now, even an already sorted array will give us average behavior.</p> 
<p><i>Curses! Foiled again!</i></p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Quicksort Analysis </h2>
<p>The analysis assumes that all elements are unique, but with some work can be generalized to
remove this assumption (Problem 7-2 in the text).</p> 

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Worst Case</h3>
<p>The previous analysis was pretty convincing, but was based on an assumption about the worst case.
This analysis proves that our selection of the worst case was correct, and also shows something
interesting: we can solve a recurrence relation with a "max" term in it!</p>

<p>PARTITION produces two subproblems, totaling size <i>n</i>-1. Suppose the partition takes place
at index <i>q</i>. The recurrence for the worst case always selects the maximum cost among all
possible ways of splitting the array (i.e., it always picks the worst possible <i>q</i>):</p>

<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-worst-1.jpg">

<p>Based on the informal analysis, we guess T(<i>n</i>) &le; <i>cn</i><sup>2</sup> for some
<i>c</i>. Substitute this guess into the recurrence:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-worst-2.jpg">

<p>The maximum value of <i>q</i><sup>2</sup> + (<i>n</i> - <i>q</i> - 1)<sup>2</sup> occurs when
<i>q</i> is either 0 or <i>n</i>-1 (the second derivative is positive), and has value
(<i>n</i> - 1)<sup>2</sup> in either case:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-worst-3.jpg">

<p>Substituting this back into the reucrrence:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-worst-4.jpg"> 

<p>We can pick <i>c</i> so that <i>c</i>(2<i>n</i> - 1) dominates &Theta;(<i>n</i>). Therefore, the worst case
running time is O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). </p>

<p>One can also show that the recurrence is &Omega;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>), so worst case is
&Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). </p>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Average (Expected) Case</h3>

<p>With a randomized algorithm, expected case analysis is much more informative than worst-case
analysis. <em><a href="Topic-10/why-expected.txt">Why?</a></em> 

<p>This analysis nicely demonstrates the use of indicator variables and two
useful strategies.</lp>

<h4>Setup</h4> 
<p>The dominant cost of the algorithm is partitioning. PARTITION removes the pivot element from
future consideration, so is called at most <i>n</i> times.</p>

<p>QUICKSORT recurses on the partitions. The amount of work in each call is a constant plus the work
done in the <tt>for</tt> loop. We can count the number of executions of the <tt>for</tt> loop by
counting the number of comparisons performed in the loop.</p>

<p>Rather than counting the number of comparisons in each call to QUICKSORT, it is easier to derive
a bound on the number of comparisons across the entire execution.</p>

<p>This is an example of a strategy that is often useful: <b>if it is hard to count one way</b>
(e.g., "locally"), <b>then count another way</b> (e.g., "globally").</p>

<p>Let <i>X</i> be the total number of comparisons in all calls to PARTITION. The total work done over the
entire execution is O(<i>n</i> + <i>X</i>), since QUICKSORT does constant work setting up <i>n</i> calls to
PARTITION, and the work in PARTITION is proportional to <i>X</i>. But what is <i>X</i>?</p>

<h4>Counting comparisons</h4> 
<p>For ease of analysis,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call the elements of A <i>z</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>z</i><sub>2</sub>,
      ... <i>z</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>, with  <i>z</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> being the <i>i</i>th
      smallest element. </li>
  <li>Define the set Z<sub><i>ij</i></sub> = {<i>z</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>,
      <i>z</i><sub><i>i</i> + 1</sub>, ... <i>z</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>}  to be the set of
      elements between  <i>z</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> and <i>z</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> inclusive. </li> 
</ul> 

<p>We want to count the number of comparisons. Each pair of elements is compared at most once,
because elements are compared only to the pivot element and then the pivot element is never in any
later call to PARTITION.</p> 

<p>Indicator variables can be used to count the comparisons. (Recall that we are counting across all
calls, not just during one partition.)</p>
<blockquote>
Let <i>X<sub>ij</sub></i> = I{ <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> is compared to <i>z<sub>j</sub></i> } 
</blockquote> 

<p>Since each pair is compared at most once, the total number of comparisons is: </p>

<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-expected-1.jpg">

<p>Taking the expectation of both sides, using linearity of expectation, and applying Lemma 5.1
(which relates expected values to probabilities):</p>
<img src="Topic-10/lemming.jpg" align="right"> 
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-expected-2.jpg">

<h4>Probability of comparisons</h4>

<p>What's the probability of comparing <i>z</i><sub>i</sub> to <i>z</i><sub>j</sub>? </p> 

<p>Here we apply another useful strategy: <b>if it's hard to determine when something happens, think
about when it does <em> not</em> happen</b>. </p>

<p>Elements (keys) in separate partitions will not be compared. If we have done two comparisons
among three elements and find that <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> &lt; <i>x</i> &lt;<i>z<sub>j</sub></i>, we
do not need to compare <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> to <i>z<sub>j</sub></i> (no further information is
gained), and QUICKSORT makes sure we do not by putting <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>z<sub>j</sub></i>
in different partitions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if either <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> or <i>z<sub>j</sub></i> is chosen as the pivot
before any other element in Z<sub><i>ij</i></sub>, then that element (as the pivot) will be compared
to <em>all</em> of the elements of Z<sub><i>ij</i></sub> except itself. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The probability that <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> is compared to <i>z<sub>j</sub></i> is the
      probability that either is the first element chosen.</li>
  <li> Since there are <i>j</i> - <i>i</i> + 1 elements in Z<sub><i>ij</i></sub>, and pivots are chosen
      randomly and independently, the probability that any one of them is chosen first is
      1/(<i>j</i> - <i>i</i> + 1). </li>
</ul> 
<p>Therefore (using the fact that these are mutually exclusive events):</p> 
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-expected-3.jpg">

<p>We can now substitute this probability into the analyis of E[<i>X</i>] above and continue it:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-expected-4.jpg">

<p>This is solved by applying equation A.7 for harmonic series, which we can match by substituting
<i>k</i> = <i>j</i> - <i>i</i> and shifting the summation indices down <i>i</i>: </p>
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-expected-5.jpg">

<p>We can get rid of that pesky "+ 1" in the denominator by dropping it and switching to inequality
(after all, this is an upper bound analysis), and now A7 (shown in box) applies: </p>

<img src="Topic-10/A7-Harmonic-Series.jpg" align="right" border="1">
<img src="Topic-10/analysis-quicksort-expected-6.jpg">

<p>Above we used the fact that logs of different bases (e.g., ln <i>n</i> and lg <i>n</i>) grow the
same asymptotically. </p>

<p>To recap, we started by noting that the total cost is O(<i>n</i> + <i>X</i>) where <i>X</i> is
the number of comparisons, and we have just shown that <i>X</i> = O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>).</p>

<p>Therefore, the <u>average running time of QUICKSORT on uniformly distributed permutations (random
data)</u> and the <u>expected running time of randomized QUICKSORT</u> are both O(<i>n</i> +
<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>) = <b>O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>)</b>. </p>

<p>This is the same growth rate as merge sort and heap sort. <u>Empirical studies show quicksort to
be a very efficient sort in practice (better than the other <i>n</i> lg <i>n</i> sorts) whenever
data is not already ordered.</u> (When it is nearly ordered, such as only one item being out of
order, insertion sort is a good choice.)</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Lower Bound for Comparison Sorts </h2>

<p>We have been studying sorts in which the only operation that is used to gain information is
pairwise comparisons between elements. So far, we have not found a sort faster than O(<i>n</i> lg
<i>n</i>). </p> 

<p>It turns out it is not possible to give a better guarantee than O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>) in a
comparison sort.</p>

<p>The proof is an example of a different level of analysis: of all <em>possible</em> algorithms of
a given type for a problem, rather than particular algorithms ... pretty powerful. </p>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Decision Tree Model</h3>
<p>A decision tree abstracts the structure of a comparison sort. A given tree represents the
comparisons made by a specific sorting algorithm on inputs of a given size. Everything else is
abstracted, and we count only comparisons. </p>

<h4>Example Decision Tree</h4>

<p>For example, here is a decision tree for insertion sort on 3 elements.</p>

<img src="Topic-10/decision-tree-insertion-sort.jpg">

<p>Each internal node represents a branch in the algorithm based on the information it determines
by comparing between elements indexed by their original positions. For example, at the nodes
labeled "2:3" we are comparing the item that was originally at position 2 with the item
originally at position 3, although they may now be in different positions.</p>

<p>Leaves represent permutations that result. For example, "&lang;2,3,1&rang;" is the permutation
where the first element in the input was the largest and the third element was the second
largest.</p> 

<p> This is just an example of one tree for one sort algorithm on 3 elements. Any given comparison
sort has one tree for each <i>n</i>. The tree models all possible execution traces for that
algorithm on that input size: a path from the root to a leaf is one computation.</p>

<h4>Reasoning over All Possible Decision Trees</h4>

<p>We don't have to know the specific structure of the trees to do the following proof. We don't
even have to specify the algorithm(s): the proof works for any algorithm that sorts by comparing
pairs of keys. We don't need to know what these comparisons are. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
  <li> The root of the tree represents the unpermuted input data.</li> 
  <li> The leaves of the tree represent the possible permuted (sorted) results.</li>
  <li> The branch at each internal node of the tree represents the outcome of a comparision that
       changes the state of the computation. </li> 
  <li> The paths from the root to the leaves represent possible courses that the computation can
       take: to get from the unsorted data at the root to the sorted result at a leaf, the algorithm
       must traverse a path from the root to the correct leaf by making a series of comparisons (and
       permuting the elements as needed) </li>
  <li> The length of this path is the runtime of the algorithm on the given data.</li> 
  <li> Therefore, if we can derive a lower bound on the height of <em>any</em> such tree, we have a
       lower bound on the running time <em>any</em> comparison sort algorithm.
</ul>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Proof of Lower Bound</h3>

<p>We get our result by showing that the number of leaves for a tree of input size <i>n</i> implies
that the tree must have minimum height O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>). This will be a lower bound on the
running time of <em>any</em> comparison sort algorithm.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are at least <i>n</i>! leaves because every permutation appears at least
      once (the algorithm must correctly sort every possible permutation): <i>l</i> &ge; <i>n</i>! </li> 
  <li>Any binary tree of height <i>h</i> has <i>l</i> &le; 2<sup><i>h</i></sup> 
      leaves (<a href="Topic-08.html">Notes #8</a>)</li> 
  <li>Putting these facts together: &nbsp; <i>n</i>! &le; <i>l</i> &le; 2<sup><i>h</i></sup> &nbsp;
      or &nbsp; 2<sup><i>h</i></sup> &ge; <i>n</i>!</li>
  <li>Taking logs: &nbsp; <i>h</i> &ge; lg(<i>n</i>!) </li>
  <li>Using Sterling's approximation (formula 3.17): &nbsp;  <i>n</i>! &gt;
      (<i>n</i>/<i>e</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup> </li> 
  <li>Substituting into the inequality:
      <blockquote>
        <i>h</i>  &nbsp; &ge;  &nbsp; lg(<i>n</i>/<i>e</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; =  &nbsp; <i>n</i> lg(<i>n</i>/<i>e</i>)<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; =  &nbsp; <i>n</i> lg <i>n</i> - <i>n</i> lg <i>e</i> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; =  &nbsp; &Omega; (<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>). 
      </blockquote>

</ul>

<p>Thus, the height of a decision tree that permutes <i>n</i> elements to all possible permutations
cannot be less than <i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>A path from the leaf to the root in the decision tree corresponds to a sequence of comparisons,
so there will always be some input that requires at least O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>) comparisions in
<em>any</em> comparision based sort.</p>

<p>There may be some specific paths from the root to a leaf that are shorter. For example, when
insertion sort is given sorted data it follows an O(<i>n</i>) path. But to give an o(<i>n</i> lg
<i>n</i>) guarantee (i.e, strictly better than O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>)), one must show that <em>
all</em> paths are shorter than O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>), or that the tree height is o(<i>n</i> lg
<i>n</i>) and we have just shown that this is impossible since it is &Omega;(<i>n</i> lg
<i>n</i>). </p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> O(n) Sorts </h2>

<p>Under some conditions it is possible to sort data without comparing two elements to each
other. If we know something about the structure of the data we can sometimes achieve O(n)
sorting. Typically these algorithms work by using information about the keys themselves to put them
"in their place" without comparisons. We only introduce these algorithms very briefly so you are
aware that they exist. </p>

<!-- -------------------- --> 
<h3>Counting Sort</h3>

<p>Assumes (requires) that keys to be sorted are integers in {0, 1, ... <i>k</i>}. </p>

<p>For each element in the input, determines how many elements are less than that input.</p>

<p>Then we can place the element directly in a position that leaves room for the elements below it. </p> 
<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-counting-sort.jpg">

<p>An example ...</p>
<img src="Topic-10/Fig-8-2-counting-sort-trace.jpg">

<p>Counting sort is a <b>stable sort</b>, meaning that two elements that are equal under their key
will stay in the same order as they were in the original sequence. This is a useful property ...</p> 

<p>Counting sort requires &Theta;(<i>n</i> + <i>k</i>). Since <i>k</i> is constant in practice, this is
&Theta;(<i>n</i>). </p>

<h3>Radix Sort</h3>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Punch_card_sorter.JPG/320px-Punch_card_sorter.JPG" align="right">
<p>Using a stable sort like counting sort, we can sort from least to most significant digit:</p>
<img src="Topic-10/Fig-8-3-radix-sort-trace.jpg">

<p>This is how punched card sorters used to work. <i> (When I was an undergraduate student my
University still had punched cards, and we had to do an assignment using them mainly so that we
would appreciate not having to use them!)</i> </p>

<p>The code is trivial, but requires a stable sort and only works on <i>n</i> <i>d</i>-digit numbers
in which each digit can take up to <i>k</i> possible values:</p>

<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-radix-sort.jpg">

<p>If the stable sort used is &Theta;(<i>n</i> + <i>k</i>) time (like counting sort) then
RADIX-SORT is &Theta;(<i>d</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>k</i>)) time.  </p>

<h3>Bucket Sort</h3>

<p>This one is reminiscent of hashing with chaining.</p>
<p>It maps the keys to the interval [0, 1), placing
each of the <i>n</i> input elements into one of <i>n</i>-1 buckets. If there are collisions,
chaining (linked lists) are used.</p>
<p>Then it sorts the chains before concatenating them.</p>
<p>It assumes
that the input is from a random distribution, so that the chains are expected to be short (bounded
by constant length).</p>

<img src="Topic-10/pseudocode-bucket-sort.jpg">

<h4>Example:</h4>

<p>The numbers in the input array A are thrown into the buckets in B according to their
magnitude. For example, 0.78 is put into bucket 7, which is for keys 0.7 &le; <i>k</i> &lt;
0.8. Later on, 0.72 maps to the same bucket: like chaining in hash tables, we "push" it onto the
beginning of the linked list. </p>

<img src="Topic-10/Fig-8-4-bucket-sort-trace.jpg">

<p>At the end, we sort the lists (B shows the lists after they are sorted; otherwise we would have
0.23, 0.21, 0.26) and then copy the values from the lists back into an array.</p>

<p>But sorting linked lists is awkward, and I am not sure why CLRS's pseudocode and figure imply
that one does this. In an alternate implementation, steps 7-9 can be done simultaneously: scan each
linked list in order, inserting the values into the array and keeping track of the next free
position. Insert the next value at this position and then scan back to find where it belongs,
swapping if needed as in insertion sort. </p>

<p>Since the values are already partially sorted, an insertion procedure won't have to scan back
very far.  For example, suppose 0.78 had been inserted after 0.72. The insertion would only have to
scan over one item to put 0.78 in its place, as all values in lists 0..6 are smaller.</p>

<p>You can also compare some of the sorts with these animations (set to 50 elements):

Do the algorithms make more sense now? </p>
