<h2>Readings and Screencasts</h2>
<p>The presentation of Red-Black Trees (RBTs) in Cormen et al. omits a major conceptual motivation:
RBTs are a binary representation of a balanced multi-way tree, and the complex operations on RBTs
correspond to simpler operations on 2-3-4 or (2,4) trees. This motivation is nicely presented by
Sedgewick, so read in this order:</p> 
<ul>
  <li> Sedgewick (1983) chapter 15 on Balanced Trees (posted in Laulima).</li>
  <li> CLRS Chapter 13 once you have understood RBTs in terms of 2-3-4 trees.</li>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Multi-Way Trees </h2>

<p>A <b>multi-way search tree</b> is an ordered tree such that </p>
<ul>
  <li>Each internal node has at least two children and stores <i>d</i>-1 key-element items
     (<i>k<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>o<sub>i</sub></i>), where <i>d</i> is the number of children</li> 
  <li>For a node with children <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> <i>v<sub>2</sub></i> ... <i>v<sub>d</sub></i>
     storing  keys <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> ... <i>k<sub>d-1</sub></i>
    <ul>
      <li>keys in the subtree of <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> are less than <i>k<sub>1</sub></i></li> 
      <li>keys in the subtree of <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> are between <i>k<sub>i-1</sub></i> and
          <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>i</i> = 2, ..., <i>d</i> - 1)</li> 
      <li>keys in the subtree of <i>v<sub>d</sub></i> are greater than <i>k<sub>d-1</sub></i></li>
    </ul> 
  <li>The leaves store no items and serve as placeholders</li>
</ul> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-multiway-search-tree.jpg">

<p><b>Multi-way inorder traversal</b> can be defined by extension of BST inorder traversal to visit
the keys in increasing order:</p> 
<blockquote>
Visit item (<i>k<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>o<sub>i</sub></i>) of node <i>v</i> between the
recursive traversals of the subtrees of <i>v</i> rooted at children <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>i+1</sub></i>.
</blockquote> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-multiway-inorder-traversal.jpg">

<p><b>Searching</b> can similarly be extended to multi-way trees by searching within each node as
well as down the tree:</p>
<ul>
  <li> At each internal node with children <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>
       ... <i>v<sub>d</sub></i> and keys <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> 
       ... <i>k<sub>d-1</sub></i>:
    <ul>
      <li><i>k</i> = <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>i</i> = 1, ... , <i>d</i> - 1): the search terminates
           with success</li> 
      <li><i>k</i> &lt; <i>k<sub>1</sub></i>: we continue the search in child
           <i>v<sub>1</sub></i></li> 
      <li> <i>k<sub>i-1</sub></i> &lt;  <i>k</i> &lt; <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>i</i> = 2, ... ,
           <i>d</i> - 1): we continue the search in child <i>v<sub>i</sub></i></li>
      <li> <i>k</i> &gt; <i>k<sub>d-1</sub></i>: we continue the search in child
           <i>v<sub>d</sub></i></li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li>Reaching an external node terminates the search unsuccessfully</li>
</ul>
<p> For example, searching for key 30:</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr><h2>(2,4), 2-4 or 2-3-4 Trees</h2>

<p>These are multi-way trees restricted in two ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Node Size Property</b>: every internal node has at least two children (one key) and at most
      four children (three keys).</li> 
  <li><b>Depth Property</b>: all of the external nodes have the same depth. (The tree is
      balanced.)</li> 
</ul>

<p>The internal nodes are called 2-nodes, 3-nodes or 4-nodes, depending on the number of children
they have.</p>

<h3>Height of (2,4) Trees and Searching</h3> 

<p><b><i>Theorem:</i> A (2,4) tree storing n items has height &Theta;(log n).</b></p>
<p>Proof: </p>

<p>Let <i>h</i> be the height of a (2,4) tree with <i>n</i> items. The tallest possible tree (worst
case) for a fixed <i>n</i> is when all internal nodes are 2-nodes (i.e., the tree is equivalent to a
binary tree), so we restrict consideration to this case. Due to the depth property, the tree at
depth <i>h</i>-1 is filled, so it is a complete binary tree.</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-2-4-tree-height.jpg" align = "right" border="1">

<p>The figure illustrates the number of nodes in each level of a complete binary tree. Since there
are at least 2<sup><i>i</i></sup> items at depth <i>i</i> = 0, ... , <i>h</i>-1 and no items
at depth <i>h</i> (the leaves store no items):<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>n</i> &ge; 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2<sup><i>h</i>-1</sup><br>
(we use &ge; because there could be more items in internal 3-nodes or 4-nodes, leading to "better
cases" where <i>n</i> increases without a penalty in <i>h</i>). </p>

<img src="Topic-11/formula-A-5.jpg" align = "right" border="1">

<p>Applying formula A5 (shown) for geometric series with <i>n</i> = <i>h</i>-1 and <i>x</i> = 2,<br> 
1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2<sup><i>h</i>-1</sup> =
<big>&Sigma;</big><sub><i>k</i>=0,<i>h</i>-1</sub>2<sup><i>k</i></sup> = (2<sup>(h-1) + 1</sup> - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2<sup><i>h</i></sup> - 1, so <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>n</i> &ge; =  2<sup><i>h</i></sup> - 1 &nbsp; or &nbsp; n + 1 &ge;
2<sup><i>h</i></p> 

<p>Taking the log of both sides: &nbsp; lg (<i>n</i> + 1)  &ge; <i>h</i>.<br> 
Thus, <i>h</i> = &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>).</p> 

<p>(See also similar facts concerning full binary trees in <a
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311f12/Notes/Topic-08.html">Topic 8</a>.)</p> 

<p>Since searching in a (2,4) tree with <i>n</i> items requires time proportional to a path from
root to leaves, searching is <b>O(lg <i>n</i>)</b> time.</p> 

<!-- ------------------------------------ -->
<h3>(2,4) Tree Insertion</h3>

<p>We will examine insertion and deletion briefly to understand the conceptual cases. </p>

<p>Insert a new item keyed by <i>k</i> into <i>(not below)</i> the parent of the leaf reached by
searching for <i>k</i>. (<i>In this respect, (2,4) trees differ from binary search trees.</i>)</p>

<pk>This preserves depth but may cause <b>overflow</b> (a node may become a 5-node).</p>

<p><i>Example:</i> Inserting 30, we find its position between 27 and 32. However inserting here
causes overflow:</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-2-4-tree-insertion.jpg">

<p>Overflow is handled with a <b>split operation</b>, as illustrated below with a simpler tree:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 5-node containing keys <i>k<sub>1</sub></i>,  <i>k<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>k<sub>3</sub></i>,
      <i>k<sub>4</sub></i> is split into a 3-node with keys <i>k<sub>1</sub></i>,
      <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> and a 2-node with key <i>k<sub>4</sub></i>.</li>
  <li>Key <i>k<sub>3</sub></i> is inserted into the parent node (as would be the case with the tree
      above).</li> 
  <li>Overflow may propagate to the parent node.</li>
  <li>A new root may be created if the root overflows.</li>
</ul>
<img src="Topic-11/GT-2-4-tree-overflow-split.jpg">

<p><i>(Note: Sedgewick splits 4-nodes on the way down while searching for the insertion position,
guaranteeing that there will be no overflow. Both Goodrich & Tamassia and Cormen et al. take the
other approach, propagating splits upwards only as needed. The asymptotic time complexity remains
the same.)</i></p> 

<h4>Time Complexity of (2,4) Insertion</h4>

<p>A tree with <i>n</i> items has &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) height. The algorithm first searches for the
insertion location, which may require visiting <i>h</i> = &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) nodes (&Theta;, not
O, because we must go to the leaves in all cases). The insertion takes &Theta;(1) time. If there is
overflow, splits (taking &Theta;(1) time each) may be propagated upwards to as many as O(lg
<i>n</i>) nodes. Since the &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) overrides the possibility of slower growing
functions in O(lg <i>n</i>), insertion is <b>&Theta;(lg <i>n</i>)</b>.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------ -->
<h3>(2,4) Tree Deletion</h3>

<p>If the entry to be deleted is in a node that has internal nodes as children, we replace the entry
to be deleted with its inorder successor and delete the latter entry.  Example: to delete key 24, we
replace it with 27 (inorder successor):  </p>
<img src="Topic-11/GT-2-4-tree-deletion.jpg">
<p>This reduces deletion of an entry to the case where the item is at the node with leaf
children.</p>

<p>Deletion of an entry from a node <i>v</i> may cause <b>underflow,</b> where node <i>v</i> becomes
a 1-node with one child and no keys. Underflow at node <i>v</i> with parent <i>u</i> is handled in
two cases. </p> 

<p><b><i>Case 1</i></b>: An adjacent sibling of <i>v</i> is a 2-node. Perform a <b>fusion operation</b>,
merging <i>v</i> with the adjacent 2-node sibling <i>w</i> and moving an entry from <i>u</i> to the merged
node <i>v'</i>.</p>
<img src="Topic-11/GT-2-4-tree-underflow-fusion.jpg">
<p>After a fusion, the underflow may propagate to the parent u, for at most O(lg <i>n</i>)
adjustments up the tree.</p>

<p><b><i>Case 2</i></b>: An adjacent sibling <i>w</i> of <i>v</i> is a 3-node or a 4-node. Perform a
<b>transfer operation:</b> move a child of <i>w</i> to <i>v</i>; an item from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>;
and an item from <i>w</i> to <i>u</i>. </p> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-2-4-tree-underflow-transfer.jpg">
<p>A transfer eliminates underflow.</p> 

<h4>Time Complexity of (2,4) Deletion</h4>

<p>The algorithm first searches for the item to delete, which requires visiting <i>h</i> =
&Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) nodes on the way down the tree, either to find a bottom level key to delete, or
to find the successor of a key in an internal node to delete. Underflow is handled with up to O(lg
<i>n</i>) fusions and transfers, each taking &Theta;(1) time. Thus deletion is <b>&Theta;(lg
<i>n</i>)</b>.</p>

<hr><h2> Red-Black Trees </h2>

<!-- ------------------------- -->
<h3>Red-Black Tree Properties</h3>

<img src="Topic-11/Simple-Red-Black-Tree.jpg" align = "right">

<p>A red-black tree (RBT) is a binary search tree with the following additional properties:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Color property</b>: Every node is either red or black. <i>(We can indicate this
      either by coloring the node or by coloring its parent link.)</i> </li>
      
  <li><b>Root property</b>: The root is black</li>
  
  <li><b>External property</b>: Every leaf is black.</li>
  
  <li><b>Internal property</b>: If a node is red, then both of its children are
      black. <i>(Hence, no two reds in a row are allowed on a simple path from the root to a
      leaf.)</i></li>
      
  <li><b>Depth property</b>: For each node, all the paths from the node to descendant leaves
      contain the same number of black nodes (the <b>black height</b> of the node).</li>
  
</ol>
<p>These properties seem rather arbitrary until we consider the correspondence with (2,4) trees
shortly, but first let's see how the properties hold in an example ... </p> 
<img src="Topic-11/Fig-13-1-RBT-Representation-a.jpg">

<!-- ------------------------- -->
<h3>Red-Black Tree Representation</h3>

<p>A single extra bit is required on each node to mark it as "red" or "black".</p> 
<p>To save space, we can represent the leaf nodes <i>and</i> the parent of the root node with a single node,
T.nil:</p>
<img src="Topic-11/Fig-13-1-RBT-Representation-b.jpg">
<p> This also simplifies the code, as we can follow pointers without having to check for
null pointers.</p>

<p>We usually don't draw T.nil: </p> 
<img src="Topic-11/Fig-13-1-RBT-Representation-c.jpg">

<!-- ---------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>RBTs as a Binary Representation of (2,4) Trees</h3>

<p>It would be rather complex to implement and manipulate 2-nodes, 3-nodes and 4-nodes. One
motivation for red-black trees is that they provide a binary tree representation of (2,4) trees,
enabling us to manipulate only one kind of node. The mapping is as follows (<em><u>you should make
sure you understand this well before going on!</u></em>): </p>
<img src="Topic-11/GT-From-2-4-to-RBT.jpg">

<p><b>Red nodes (and the links from their parents) capture the <i>internal structure of a (2,3)
node</i>;</b></p>

<p><b>Black nodes (and the links from their parents) capture the <i>structure of the (2,3)
tree</i> itself.</b> </p>

<!-- --------------------------- -->
<h3>RBTs as Binary Search Trees</h3>
            
<p>At the same time as they represent (2,4) trees, <i><b>RBTs are also Binary Search Trees</b></i>:
they satisfy the Binary Search Tree property. For example, here is a RBT: we can search for keys or
enumerate elements in order as usual:</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBTs.jpg">

<p>In order to maintain the Red-Black-Tree properties, it will be necessary to do structural
rotations. These rotations are designed to not disrupt the BST property. For example, this rotation
does not disturb the BST ordering of keys 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19:</p> 
<img src="Topic-11/Fig-13-3-Rotation-BST.jpg">

<h4>Height of Red-Black Trees and Searching</h4> 
<p>Theorem: A red-black tree storing n items has height &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>). <br> Proof:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Let <i>h</i> be the height of a red-black tree with <i>n</i> items</li>
  <li> By property 4, there cannot be more red nodes (and links) on a simple path from the root to 
       a leaf than there are black nodes (and links). </li>
  <li> Therefore the black height of the root of the tree is between <i>h</i> and <i>h</i>/2. 
  <li> The black height of the root of the red-black tree corresponds to the height <i>h'</i> of the
       (2,4) tree that the red-black tree represents (since red nodes/links in the RBT represent the
       internal structure of the nodes in the (2,4) tree). </li>
  <li> From the theorem concerning the height of (2,4) trees, <i>h'</i> is &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>). 
 <li> Since <i>h</i> is no more than twice <i>h'</i>, <i>h</i> is also &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>).</li> 
</ul>
<p>(See Cormen et al. for a proof not relying on (2,4) trees.)</p> 

<p>Therefore, searching in a red-black tree with <i>n</i> items takes <b>O(lg <i>n</i>)</b> time (O rather
than &Theta; as we may find the key in an internal node). </p>

<p>We now consider insertion and deletion. Please see the textbook for the many details of
implementation in pseudocode, etc.: here we will concentrate on seeing how the RBT operations
correspond to (2,4) tree operations.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------- -->
<h3> Insertion in Red-Black Trees </h3>

<p>To insert an element with key <i>k</i>, perform the insertion for binary search trees (except
that conceptually we insert <i>k</i> in an internal node with null children, not at a leaf node),
and color the newly inserted node <i>z</i> red, unless it is the root.</p>

<p>This preserves the color, root, external, and depth properties. <em>(You should check this in the
example below.)</em></p>

<p>If the parent <i>v</i> of <i>z</i> is black, this also preserves the internal property and we are
done.</p> 
<p>Else (<i>v</i> is red), we have a <b>double red</b> (i.e., a violation of the internal property), which 
requires a reorganization of the tree. For example, insert 4:</p> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-insertion.jpg">

<p>A double red with child <i>z</i> and parent <i>v</i> is dealt with in two cases. Let <i>w</i> be
the sibling of <i>v</i> (and hence the uncle of <i>z</i>).</p>

<p><b><i>Case 1:</i></b> <i>w</i> is black. The double red is an <i><b>incorrect representation</b></i> of
a 4-node. (We will fix this with restructuring). For example, the RBT on the left is an incorrect
representation of the (2,4) tree on the right:</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-double-red-case-1.jpg">

<p><b><i>Case 2:</i></b> w is red.  The double red corresponds to an <i><b>overflow</b></i> in the (2,4)
tree. (We will fix this with recoloring, which is the equivalent of a (2,4) split.) For example:</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-double-red-case-2.jpg">

<h4>Restructuring</h4>

<p><b>Restructuring</b> remedies a child-parent double red when the parent red node has a black
sibling. It restores the correct representation (internal property) of a 4-node, leaving other
RBT and BST properties intact: </p>
<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-restructuring.jpg">

<p>There are four restructuring configurations depending on whether the double red nodes are left or
right children. They all lead to the same end configuration of a black with two red children:</p> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-restructuring-configurations.jpg">

<p>After a restructuring, the double red has been remedied without violating any of the other
properties <em>(you should verify this)</em>: there is no need to propagate changes upwards.</p>

<p>Notice that the height of the subtree tree has been reduced by one. <b><em>This is the operation
that keeps the trees balanced to within a constant factor of lg(<i>n</i>) height</em></b>, by
ensuring that the height of the RBT is no more than twice that of the (necessarily balanced) 2-4
tree it represents. <em>Do you see why?</em> </p>

<h4>Recoloring</h4> 

<p><b>Recoloring</b> remedies a child-parent double red when the parent red node has a red
sibling. The parent <i>v</i> and its sibling <i>w</i> become black and the grandparent <i>u</i>
becomes red, unless it is the root. We recolor a non-root grandparent in order to maintain equal
black height (in case the grandparent has a sibling).</p>

<p>Recoloring is equivalent to performing a split on a 5-node in a (2,4) tree. (When there is a double red
and yet another red in the parent's sibling, we are trying to collect too many keys under the
grandparent.) For example, the RBT recoloring on the top corresponds to the (2,4) transformation
on the bottom:</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-recoloring.jpg">

<p>Notice that in this example the parent "4" is now red, meaning it belongs to its parent node in the
(2,4) tree. The double red violation may propagate to this parent in the RBT, which corresponds
to the overflow propagating up the (2,4) tree, requiring further repair.</p>

<p> Be aware that 3-nodes and overloaded nodes have more than one possible representation as a
red-black tree, and in particular this affects which key is promoted by the recoloring. For example,
the above overloaded 2-4 node of keys {2, 4, 6, 7} can also be represented by either of the
following trees, and you can easily verify that recoloring will promote the key 6 in the 2-4
tree.</p>

<img src="Topic-11/RBT-recoloring-alternate-cases.jpg">

<h4>Time Complexity of RBT Insertion</h4>

<p>We already established that insertion in (2,4) trees is &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) due to their
height. Since RBTs are only at most twice as high, we might expect this result to transfer, and it
does, but it needs to be shown separately since the manipulations of the RBT are different. So: </p>

<ul>
  <li> The algorithm first searches for the insertion location, which will require visiting <i>h</i>
       =  &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) nodes on the way down the tree (since we are searching for a leaf
       node and the tree is balanced).</li>
  <li> Adding the item takes O(1). </li>
  <li> Recolorings and restructurings are &Theta;(1) each, and we perform at most O(lg <i>n</i>)
       recolorings and <em>one</em> restructuring propagating structural changes back up the
       tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus insertion is <b>&Theta;(lg <i>n</i>).</b></p> 

<p>Note: A top-down version of this algorithm is also possible, restructuring on the way down and
requiring only one pass through the tree. See the Sedgewick reading distributed.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------- -->
<h3> Deletion in Red-Black Trees </h3>

<p>To remove item with key <i>k</i>, we first perform the BST deletion (modified for our
representational changes using T.nil).</p>

<p>Because deletion of a node higher in the tree involves replacing it with its successor, which is
then deleted, deletion always involves an internal and an external node.</p>

<p> We can preserve the RBT properties at the new internal location of the successor by giving the
successor the color of the node deleted, so we need only be concerned with possible violations of
RBT properties at the bottom of the tree, where the successor was moved from, or where a node
without a successor was deleted. </p>

<p>Let <i>v</i> be the internal node removed, <i>w</i> the external node removed, and <i>r</i> the
sibling of <i>w</i>:</p>

<pre>
    x       
     \               x                    
      v       ==>     \
     / \               r 
    r   w
</pre> 
<p>If either <i>v</i> or <i>r</i> was red, we color <i>r</i> black and we are done (the number of
black nodes has not changed).</p>

<p>Else (<i>v</i> and <i>r</i> were both black), we have removed a black node, violating the depth
property. We fix this by coloring <i>r</i> <b>double black,</b> a fictional color. (Intuitively, the
black of both <i>v</i> and <i>r</i> have been absorbed into <i>r</i>.) Now we have the correct
"amount" of black on this path from root to leaf, but the double black violates the color
property. </p>

<p>Fixing this will require a reorganization of the tree. Example: deletion of 8 causes a double black:</p> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-deletion-double-black.jpg">

<p>A double black corresponds to <i><b>underflow</b></i> in (2,4) trees (and here the images
I am borrowing from Goodrich &amp; Tamassia go to greyscale!):</p>
<img src="Topic-11/GT-double-black-as-underflow.jpg">

<p>Goodrich &amp; Tamassia's algorithm for remedying a double black node <i>w</i> with sibling
<i>y</i> considers <u>three cases</u>, discussed below. <em>(Note that these are different from
CLRS's four cases!)</em></p>

<p><b><i>Case 1:</i></b> <i>y</i> is black and has a red child: Perform a RBT <b>restructuring</b>,
equivalent to a (2,4) <b>transfer</b>, and we are done.</p>

<p>For example, if we have the RBT on the left corresponding to underflow in the (2,4) tree on the
right: </p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-DB-remedy-case-1-1.jpg">

<p>... we do the following restructuring: </p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-DB-remedy-case-1-2.jpg">

<p><b><i>Case 2:</i></b> <i>y</i> is black and its children are both black: Perform a RBT
<b>recoloring</b>, equivalent to a (2,4) <b>fusion</b>, which may propagate up the double black
violation.</p>

<p>If the double-black reaches the root we can just remove it, as it is now on <em>all</em>
of the paths from the root to the leaves, so does not affect property 5, the depth property.</p>

<p>For example, if we have the RBT on the left corresponding to underflow in the (2,4) tree on the
right: </p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-DB-remedy-case-2-1.jpg">

<p>... we do the following recoloring: the black node <i>y</i> is colored red, and the double
black node <i>r</i> is colored ordinary black: </p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-DB-remedy-case-2-2.jpg">

<p>The root of the above subtree takes on an extra black, which propagates only if it was previously
black and is not the root. If it was red it merely turns black; if it
was the root the extra black no longer affects the balanced black height of the
tree.</p>

<p><b><i>Case 3:</i></b> <i>y</i> is red: Perform a RBT <b>adjustment</b>, equivalent to choosing a
different representation of a 3-node, after which either Case 1 or Case 2 applies.</p>

<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-DB-remedy-case-3.jpg">
<p> These are both representations of the following 2-4 tree, but the transformation allows one of
the other cases to apply, reducing duplication of cases.</p> 
<img src="Topic-11/GT-RBT-DB-remedy-case-3-2-4.jpg">

<p>The CLRS chapter divides the situation up into four cases: try to see whether you can map
between the above cases and theirs!</p>

<h4>Time Complexity of RBT Deletion</h4>

<p>The analysis is similar to the previous ones: &Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) search to find the deletion
point (the item to delete may be in an internal node, but we always find its successor in any case,
which is at the bottom of the tree), followed by deletion and restructuring O(1) operations that are
propagated at most up O(lg <i>n</i>) levels. Deletion is  <b>&Theta;(lg <i>n</i>)</b>. </p>

  <dd>A java applet. You can go step by step and it tells you the rules violated and the fixes. Must
    click on "next step" until done with process. To delete, click on Delete and then on the node to
    be deleted.</dd>

  <dd> A flash animation: slides with voice-over. It goes kind of fast (little time to figure out
    what property is being fixed in each case), and does not let you control slide by slide. </dd>

<hr><h2>Related Data Structures</h2>

<p><b>AVL Trees,</b> named for their authors, are the oldest balanced trees. They are binary trees with
the requirement that the heights of the left and right subtree of any given node differ at most by
1. A small amount of extra storage is needed to record height differences. Their operations are
O(lg <i>n</i>) like RBTs, but may require  O(lg <i>n</i>) rotations to rebalance. </p>

<p><b>Splay Trees</b> are binary trees in which an adjustment moving a node towards the root called
<i>splaying</i> is done after every access (including search). There are no rules about properties
to maintain and no labels. Amazingly, splaying alone is enough to guarantee  O(lg <i>n</i>) behavior
in an amortized sense: we will use these as an example when we cover chapter 17 Amortized
analysis. They also make frequently accessed items more accessible. </p>

<p><b>B-Trees,</b> covered in Chapter 18 of Cormen et al. (but not in this course), are balanced
multi-way trees that allow up to M keys per node for large M. They are used for trees in external
(disk) storage, where speed is optimized by making the size of a node be the same as the size of a
block read in by one disk read.</p>

    <td>&Theta;(lg <i>n</i>)</td>
    <td>&Theta;(lg <i>n</i>) </td>
    <td>Complex to implement.</td>

</table>
<p>From this we can see that hash tables are most efficient expected behavior when no ordered methods
are needed, and red-black trees give us the best guarantee when ordering matters. </p>
