<hr><h2> Dynamic Disjoint Sets (Union Find) </h2>

<p>Two sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are <b>disjoint</b> if they have no element in common.</p> 

<p>Sometimes we need to group n distinct elements into a collection &Scaron; of disjoint sets
&Scaron; = {<i>S</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>S<sub>k</sub></i>} that may change over time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&Scaron; is a set of sets: {{<i>x</i>, ... }, ..., {<i>y</i>, ... }} 
  <li>Each set <i>S<sub>i</sub></i> &in; &Scaron; is identified by a <b>representative</b>, which is
      some member of the set (e.g., <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>).</li>  
  <li> It does not matter which member is the representative, as long as the representative remains
  the same while the set is not modified.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Disjoint set data structures are also known as <b>Union-Find</b> data structures, after the two
operations in addition to creation. (Applications often involve a mixture of searching for set
membership and merging sets.) </p> 

<!-- ----------- --> 
<h3>Operations</h3> 

<blockquote>

<b>Make-Set(<i>x</i>)</b>: make a new set <i>S<sub>i</sub></i> = {<i>x</i>}
<i>(<i>x</i> will be its representative)</i> and add <i>S<sub>i</sub></i> to &Scaron;.

</blockquote> 

<blockquote>

<b>Union(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</b>: if
<i>x</i> &in; <i>S<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>y</i> &in; <i>S<sub>y</sub></i>, then
&Scaron; &larr; &Scaron; &minus; <i>S<sub>x</sub></i> &minus; <i>S<sub>y</sub></i> <big> &cup;</big>
{<i>S<sub>x</sub></i> <big> &cup; </big><i>S<sub>y</sub></i>} <i>(that is, combine the two sets
<i>S<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>y</sub></i>)</i>. 
<ul>
    <li>The representative of <i>S<sub>x</sub></i> <big>&cup;</big> <i>S<sub>y</sub></i> is any
        member of that new set (implementations often use the representative of one of
        <i>S<sub>x</sub></i> or <i>S<sub>y</sub></i>.) </li>
    <li>Destroys <i>S<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>y</sub></i>, since the sets must be disjoint
        (they cannot co-exist with <i>S<sub>x</sub></i> <big>&cup;</big>
        <i>S<sub>y</sub></i>). </li>
</ul> 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote>
<b>Find-Set(<i>x</i>)</b>: return the representative of the set containing <i>x</i>.
</blockquote> 

<!-- ----------- --> 
<h3>Analysis</h3> 

<p>We analyze in terms of: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>n</i> = number of Make-Set operations, i.e., the number of sets initially involved</li> 
  <li><i>m</i> = total number of operations</li>
</ul>

<p>Some facts we can rely on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>m</i> &ge; <i>n</i></li>
  <li>Can have at most <i>n</i>&minus;1 Union operations, since after <i>n</i>&minus;1 Unions, only
      1 set remains.</li>
  <li>It can be helpful for analysis to assume that the first <i>n</i> operations are Make-Set
      operations (put all the elements we will be working with in singleton sets to start with).</li> 
</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Applications of Disjoint Sets</h2>

<p>Union-Find on disjoint sets is used to find structure in other data structures, such as a
graph. We initially assume that all the elements are distinct by putting them in singleton sets, and
then we merge sets as we discover the structure by which the elements are related.</p>

<!-- ---------------------------- --> 
<h3>Finding Connected Components</h3> 

<p>Recall from <a href="Topic-14.html">Topic 14</a> that for a graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V</i>,
<i>E</i>), vertices <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are in the same <b>connected component</b> if and only if
there is a path between them. </p>

<p>Here are the algorithms for computing connected components and then for testing whether two items
are in the same component:</p>

<img src="Topic-16/pseudocode-connected-components.jpg">
<img src="Topic-16/pseudocode-same-components.jpg">

<p><i>Would that work with a directed graph?</i></p>

<h4>Example</h4> 
<img src="Topic-16/Fig-21-1-finding-connected-components.jpg">

<img src="Topic-16/ti-chats.jpg" align="right">

<p>Although it is easy to see the connected components above, the utility of the algorithm becomes
more obvious when we deal with large graphs (such as pictured)!</p>

<h4>Alternatives</h4> 

<p>In a <em>static</em> undirected graph, it is faster to run Depth-First Search (exercise 22.3-12),
or for static directed graphs the strongly connected components algorithm of <a
 href="Topic-14.html">Topic 14</a> (section 22.5), which consists of two DFS. But in some
applications edges may be added to the graph. In this case, union-find with disjoint sets is faster
than re-running the DFS.</p>

<!-- ---------------------- --> 
<h3>Minimum Spanning Trees</h3> 

<p> In the next topic we cover algorithms to find <i>minimum spanning trees</i> of graphs. Kruskal's
algorithm will use Union-Find operations. </p> 

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Linked List Representations of Disjoint Sets </h2>

<p>One might think that lists are the simplest approach, but there is a better approach that is not
any more complex: this section is mainly for comparision purposes.</p>

<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>Each set is represented using an unordered singly linked list. The list object has
attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>head</b>: pointing to the first element in the list, the set's representative.</li>
  <li><b>tail</b>: pointing to the last element in the list.</li>
</ul>

<img src="Topic-16/Fig-21-2-linked-list-S1.jpg" align="right">

<p>Each object in the list has attributes for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>next</b>
  <li>The <b>set member</b> (e.g., the vertex in the graph being analyzed)</li>
  <li>A pointer to the list object that represents the <b>set</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>First try:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make-Set(<i>x</i>): create a singleton list containing <i>x</i></li>
  <li>Find-Set(<i>x</i>): follow the pointer back to the list object, and then follow the
      <tt>head</tt> pointer to the representative</li>
  <li>Union(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>): append <i>y</i>'s lists onto the end of <i>x</i>'s list.
      <ul>
        <li>Use <i>x</i>'s tail pointer to find the end.</li>
        <li>Need to update the pointer back to the set object for every node on <i>y</i>'s list.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, let's take the union of <i>S</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>2</sub>, replacing
<i>S</i><sub>1</sub>:</p>

<img src="Topic-16/Fig-21-2-linked-list-representation.jpg">

<p>This can be slow for large data sets. For example, suppose we start with <i>n</i> singletons and
always happend to append the larger list onto the smaller one in a sequence of merges:</p>
<img src="Topic-16/Fig-21-3-worst-case-alt.jpg">
<p>If there are <i>n</i> Make-Sets and <i>n</i> Unions, the amortized time per operation is
O(<i>n</i>)!</p> 

<p>A <b>weighted-union heuristic</b> speeds things up: always append the smaller list to the larger
list (so we update fewer set object pointers). Althought a single union can still take
&Omega;(<i>n</i>) time (e.g., when both sets have <i>n</i>/2 members), a sequence of <i>m</i>
operations on <i>n</i> elements takes O(<i>m</i> + <i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>) time. </p>

<p><b><i>Sketch of proof:</i></b> Each Make-Set and Find-Set still takes O(1). Consider how many
times each object's set representative pointer must be updated during a sequence of <i>n</i> Union
operations. It must be in the smaller set each time, and after each Union the size of this smaller
set is at least double the size. So: </p>

<img src="Topic-16/representative-update-bound.jpg">

<p>Each representative set for a given element is updated &le; lg <i>n</i> times, and there are
<i>n</i> elements plus <i>m</i> operations. However, we can do better!</p> 

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Forest Representations of Disjoint Sets </h2>

<p>The following is a classic representation of Union-Find, due to Tarjan (1975). The set of sets is
represented by a forest of trees. The code is as simple as the analysis of runtime is complex.</p>

<h3>Representation</h3>
<img src="Topic-16/disjoint-set-forest.jpg" align="right">
<ul>
  <li>Each tree represents a set.</li>
  <li>The root of the tree is the set representative.</li>
  <li>Each node points only to its parent (no child pointers needed).</li>
  <li>The root points to itself as parent.
</ul>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make-Set(<i>x</i>): create a single node tree with <i>x</i> at the root</li>
  <li>Find-Set(<i>x</i>): follow parent pointers back to the root</li>
  <li>Union(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>): make one root a child of the other. (This in itself could degenerate
  to a linear list-like tree, but we will fix this below.)</li> 
</ul>
<img src="Topic-16/disjoint-set-union-alt.jpg">

<h4>Heuristics</h4>

<p>In order to avoid degeneration to linear trees, and achieve amazing amortized performance, these
two heuristics are applied:</p>

<p><b>Union by Rank</b>: make the root of the "smaller" tree a child of the root of the "larger" 
tree. But rather than size we use <b>rank</b>, an upper bound on the height of each node (stored in
the node).</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Rank of singleton sets is 0.</li>
  <li>When taking the Union of two trees of equal rank, choose one arbitrarily to be the parent
      and increment its rank by one. <i>(Why is it incremented?)</i> </li>
  <li>When taking the Union of two trees of unequal rank, the tree with lower rank becomes the
      child, and ranks are unchanged. <i>(Why does this make sense?)</i></li> 
</ul>

<p><b>Path Compression</b>: When running Find-Set(<i>x</i>), make all nodes on the path from
<i>x</i> to the root direct children of the root. For example, Find-Set(a):</p>
<img src="Topic-16/Fig-21-5-path-compression-alt.jpg">

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>The algorithms are very simple! (But their analysis is complex!) We assume that nodes <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> are tree nodes with the client's element data already initialized.</p>

<img src="Topic-16/pseudocode-disjoint-set-forest.jpg">

<p>Link implements the union by rank heuristic.</p> 
<p>Find-Set implements the path compression heuristic. It makes a recursive pass up the tree to find
the path to the root, and as recursion unwinds it updates each node on the path to point directly to
the root. (This means it is not tail recursive, but as the analysis shows, the paths are very unlikely to
be long.)</p>


<h3>Time Complexity</h3>

<p>The analysis can be found in section 21.4. It is very involved, and I only expect you to know
what is discussed below. It is based on a very fast growing function: </p>
<img src="Topic-16/A_k-j.jpg">

<p><i>A<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>j</i>) is a variation of <b>Ackerman's Function</b>, which is what you
will find in most classic texts on the subject. The function grows so fast that
<i>A</i><sub>4</sub>(1) = 16<sup>512</sup> is <em>much</em> larger than the number of atoms in the observable
universe (10<sup>80</sup>)!</p>

<p>The result uses <b>&alpha;(<i>n</i>),</b> a single parameter inverse of <i>A<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>j</i>)
defined as the lowest <i>k</i> for which <i>A<sub>k</sub></i>(1) is at least <i>n</i>:</p>
<img src="Topic-16/growth-inverse-ackermann.jpg" align="right" border="1">
<blockquote>
&alpha;(<i>n</i>) = min{<i>k</i> : <i>A<sub>k</sub></i>(1) &ge; <i>n</i>} 
</blockquote>

<p>&alpha;(<i>n</i>) grows <em>very</em> slowly, as shown in the table. We are highly unlikely to
ever encounter &alpha;(<i>n</i>) &gt; 4 (we would need input size much greater than the number of
atoms in the universe). Although its growth is strictly larger than a constant, for all practical
purposes we can treat &alpha;(<i>n</i>) as a constant.</p>

<p>The analysis of section 21.4 shows that the running time is <u><b>O(<i>m</i>
&alpha;(<i>n</i>))</b> for a sequence of <i>m</i></u> <tt>Make-Set</tt>, <tt>Find-Set</tt> and
<tt>Union</tt> operations, or <u><b>O(&alpha;(<i>n</i>))</b> per operation</u>. Since
&alpha;(<i>n</i>) &gt; 4 is highly unlikely, for all practical purposes the cost of a sequence of
<i>m</i> such operations is O(<i>m</i>), or O(1) amortized cost per operation!!</p>

<p>We now return to Graphs. We'll see Union-Find used when we cover minimum spanning trees. </p>
