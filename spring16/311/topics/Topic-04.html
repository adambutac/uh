<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>Stacks</h2>

<p>Stacks follow the <b>Last In, First Out (LIFO)</b> principle. They are useful when a problem has
goal-subgoal structure, and we need to keep track of higher level goals or processes when we set
them aside to pursue subgoals or sub-processes (e.g., the run-time stack of a computer operating
system, or keeping track of neighbor vertices yet to be visited when searching a graph). </p> 

<h3>Stack ADT</h3>
<p>We start by specifying the desired behavior of stacks before looking at implementations. Here's
the Stack ADT written as a simple Java interface:</p> 
<pre>
  public interface <b>Stack</b> {
  // ADT that stores and retrieves Objects in a LIFO manner

     public <b>Stack</b>( ); 
     // Create an instance of ADT Stack and initialize it to the empty stack.

     public void <b>push</b>(Object o); 
     // Insert object o at the top of the stack.

     public Object <b>pop</b>( ); 
     // Remove and return the top (most recently pushed) object on the stack.
     // Error occurs if the stack is empty. 
 
     public int <b>size</b>( ); 
     // Return the number of objects in the stack.

     public boolean <b>isEmpty</b>( ); 
     // Return a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty.

     public Object <b>top</b>( ); 
     // Return the top (most recently pushed) object on the stack, without 
     // removing it. Error occurs if the stack is empty.
  }
</pre>

<p><b>Properties</b>, given <tt>s</tt> a stack instance:</p>
<ol>
      <li>{ <tt>push(<i>s</i>,<i>e</i>); <i>s</i>.top()</tt> }
           returns value <tt><i>e</i></tt> </li>
      <li>{ <tt>push(<i>s</i>,<i>e</i>); <i>s</i>.pop()</tt> }
           returns value <tt><i>e</i></tt> and leaves
          <tt><i>s</i></tt> in the same state </li>  
      <li>{ <tt><i>s</i> = new(); <i>s</i>.isEmpty() } returns true </tt></li>
      <li>{ <tt>push(<i>s</i>,<i>i</i>); <i>s</i>.isEmpty() } returns false </tt></li>
      <li>if <tt>s.isEmpty()</tt> then <tt>s.top()</tt> is an error, and does not change
          <tt>s</tt></li>
      <li>if <tt>s.isEmpty()</tt> then <tt>s.pop()</tt> is an error, and does not change
          <tt>s</tt></li> 
      <li>if <tt>s.isEmpty()</tt> then <tt>s.size() == 0</tt> </li>
      <li>if <tt>s.size() == <i>n</i></tt> then after <tt> s.push(o), s.size() == <i>n</i>+1</tt></li>
      <li>if <tt>&not;s.isEmpty()</tt> and <tt>s.size() == <i>n</i></tt> then after <tt>s.pop(o), s.size() ==
          <i>n</i>-1.</tt> </li>
</ol>

<p><i>What is the relationship of stacks to method execution in the Java Virtual Machine?</i></p>
<p><i>What is the relationship of stacks to recursion?</i></p>

<h3>Array Implementation</h3> 

<p>Assume instance variables (fields) of object array <tt>S</tt> and <tt>int top</tt>. The three
essential operations follow. (I am modifying the book's pseudocode slightly.)</p>

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-1-a-Stack.jpg" align="right"> 
<pre>
  boolean <b>isEmpty</b> ( ) 
  1     if top == 0 
  2       return TRUE
  3     else
  4       return FALSE

  void <b>push</b>(Object o)
  1     top = top + 1
  2     S[top] = o                // what might happen here?

  Object <b>pop</b>( )
  1     if isEmpty()
  2       error "stack underflow" // or throw new StackException (...) 
  3     else
  4       top = top - 1
  5       return S[top+1]         // we comment on this later 
</pre>

<p><i>What is the asymptotic complexity of these operations?</i></p>

<p>The potential error in <tt>push</tt> is an implementation concern outside of the scope of the
<em>logical</em> definition of the stack ADT. How might it be handled?</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Let's start with this stack:</p> 
<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-1-a-Stack.jpg"><br><br>
<table width="90%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>Push 17, and then 3:</td>
    <td>Pop once:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-1-b-Stack.jpg"> </td>
    <td> <img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-1-c-Stack.jpg"> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><i>What is the status of S[top+1] after pop returns? Why might that be a problem?</i></p>

<h4> An Improvement </h4>

<pre>
  Object <b>pop</b>( )  // version that dereferences objects for garbage collection
  1     if isEmpty()
  2       error "stack underflow" 
  3     else
  4       o = S[top]
  5       S[top] = null  // don't keep references to objects not really there 
  6       top = top - 1
  7       return o 
</pre>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>Queues</h2>

<p>Queues operate in a <b>First In, First Out (FIFO)</b>, like what the British call a "queue" at
the post office or bank. They are also very useful for managing prioritization of tasks in
computing. </p> 

<h3>Queue ADT</h3>
<p>Again, expressed as a simple Java interface:</p> 
<pre>
  public interface <b>Queue</b>{
  // ADT that stores and retrieves Objects in a FIFO manner

    public <b>Queue</b>( ); 
    // Create an instance of ADT Queue and initialize it to the empty queue.

    public void <b>enqueue</b>(Object o); 
    // Insert object o at the rear of the queue.

    public Object <b>dequeue</b>( );
    // Remove and return the frontmost (least recently queued) object from the queue. 
    // queue. Error occurs if the queue is empty.

    public int <b>size</b>( ); 
    // Return the number of objects in the queue.

    public boolean <b>isEmpty</b>( ); 
    // Return a boolean indicating whether the queue is empty.

    public Object <b>front</b>( ); 
    // Return the front (least recently queued) object in the queue, without 
    // removing it. Error occurs if the queue is empty.
  }
</pre> 
<p><b>Properties</b> (given <tt>q</tt> a queue instance): are very similar to those for Stack,
    except for operations where ordering matters (FIFO rather than LIFO). Replace the first two
    properties for Stack with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>if <tt>q.enqueue(o1) </tt> occurs before <tt>q.enqueue(o2)</tt> then successive
      <tt>q.dequeue()</tt> returns <tt>o1</tt> before <tt>o2</tt></li> 
  <li><tt>q.front() </tt> returns the least recently enqueued element that has not been dequeued.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then rewrite the other properties with substitution <tt>{enqueue/push, dequeue/pop,
    front/top}</tt>. </p> 

<h3> Array Implementation</h3>

<p>Assume three instance variables (fields): object array <tt>Q</tt>; <tt>int head</tt> indexing the next element to
dequeue; and <tt>int tail</tt> indexing the next place a new element may be placed.</p>

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-2-a-Queue.jpg" align = "right">

<pre>
  boolean <b>isEmpty</b> ( ) 
  1     if head == tail
  2       return TRUE
  3     else
  4       return FALSE
  
  void <b>enqueue</b>(Object o) 
  1     Q[tail] = o
  2     if tail == length  
  3       tail = 1           // wrap around
  4     else
  5       tail = tail + 1
  
  Object <b>dequeue</b>( )     
  1     o = Q[head]
  2     if head == length
  3       head = 1
  4     else 
  5       head = head + 1
  6     return o
</pre>

<p>The queue is full when <tt>head == tail + 1</tt>; an error results if enqueue is called (again,
this is an implementation concern outside the logical definition of the ADT).</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Beginning with this Queue: </p> 
<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-2-a-Queue.jpg"><br><br>

<table width="90%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>Enqueue 17, 3 and 5 (notice wrap-around): </td>
    <td>Dequeue once:  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-2-b-Queue.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-2-c-Queue.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The same issue concerning object dereferencing applies.</p>

<h4>Variation using modular arithmetic</h4>

<p>This version handles dereferencing but does not check for overflow or underflow. It assumes that
the array index starts with 0, but can be changed for 1-based indexing. </p>

<pre>
  void <b>enqueue</b>(Object o) 
  1     Q[tail] = o
  2     tail = (tail + 1) mod length // mod is % in Java 
  
  Object <b>dequeue</b>( )
  1     o = Q[head]
  2     Q[head] = null               // allow garbage collection!
  3     head = (head + 1) mod length 
  4     return o
</pre>
<p><i>What is the asymptotic complexity of these operations?</i></p>

<h3>Deques</h3>

<p>One can combine the stack and queue concepts into a double-ended queue (deque) that allows
insertion and deletion at both ends. O(1) procedures are possible for all insertion and deletion
algorithms. </p> 

<a name="lists">&nbsp;</a> 
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>Lists </h2>

<p>Lists store objects in linear order.  We will assume that list elements have a <tt>key</tt> and
may have other satellite data. </p>

<p>In an <b>unsorted</b> list, we assume no particular order to the elements (the order is
arbitrary). In a <b>sorted</b> list or set, the elements are ordered by key.</p>

<p>A suitable ADT for lists will be given later, in the form of <tt>DynamicSet</tt>. </p> 

<h3>Linked Lists</h3>

<p><b>Linked lists</b> use list element objects to hold the data (here in the form of a
<tt>key</tt>), and record the linear order using <tt>next</tt> pointers.  <b>Doubly linked lists</b>
also have <tt>prev</tt> pointers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>L.head</tt> points to the first element in the list.</li>
  <li>If <tt>x.next == nil</tt> then x is the last element of the list.</li>
  <li>If <tt>x.prev == nil</tt> then x is the first element of the list.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>What are the advantages of adding <tt>prev</tt> pointers?</i></p> 

<p>Our examples will assume List instance variables for <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt>, and
ListElement instance variables <tt>key</tt>, <tt>next</tt>, and <tt>prev</tt>. (Note: public
interfaces for ADTs would probably not expose listElement: see discussion under Dynamic Sets
later.)</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>The procedure for seaching is the same for singly and doubly linked lists:</p>

<pre>
  ListElement <b>listSearch</b>(Key k)
  1     e = head
  2     while e &ne; null and e.key &ne; k
  3       e = e.next 
  4     return e
</pre>

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-3-a-DLL.jpg">

<p><i>What is returned if <tt>k</tt> is not in the list?</i></p>

<p><i>What is the worst case complexity of this algorithm?</i></p>

<h3>Inserting and Deleting</h3>

<p>Since you are familiar with singularly linked lists from your previous studies, we'll go direct
to doubly linked lists, but recall that with singly linked lists you had to be careful to keep track
of the tail end of the list that you had "snipped off" during an insertion or deletion. The same
applies here, but we also have to manage prev pointers. </p>

<pre>
  void <b>listInsert</b>(ListElement e) // inserts at beginning of list
  1     e.next = head
  2     if head &ne; null
  3       head.prev = e 
  4     head = e
  5     e.prev = null
</pre>

<p>Inserting 25: <br> <img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-3-b-DLL.jpg"></p>

<pre>
  void <b>listDelete</b>(ListElement e) // removes from list, wherever it is 
  1     if e.prev &ne; null
  2       e.prev.next = e.next
  3     else 
  4       head = e.next 
  5     if e.next &ne; null
  6       e.next.prev = e.prev
</pre>

<p>Deleting the element keyed by 4: <br><img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-3-c-DLL.jpg"></p> 

<p><i>What is the worst case complexity of these algorithms?</i></p>

<p><i>What about garbage collection in listDelete? Same problem as for pop and dequeue?</i></p>

<h3>Circular DLLs with Sentinels</h3>

<p>CLRS discuss adding an extra <b>sentinel</b> element that marks the beginning of the list
and making the linked list circular so that we don't have to check for null (falling off the end of
the list). It also enables us to get to the end of the list quickly</p>

<p>Sentinels remove the need for a conditional test, but this only speeds up operations a small
constant, at the cost of an extra listElement object per every list. Their use is more compelling if
you often need to go to the end of the list.</p>

<p>For example, here is the above list as a circular doubly linked list. (<tt>L.nil</tt> references
the sentinel.)</p> 

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-4-b-DLL-Sentinel.jpg">

<pre> 
  void <b>listInsert</b>(ListElement e) // Sentinel version 
  1     e.next = nil.next           
  2     nil.next.prev = e 
  3     nil.next = e 
  5     e.prev = nil
</pre>

<p>Insert 25: <img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-4-c-DLL-Sentinel.jpg"></p> 

<p><i>Let's insert something into the empty list ...</i><br>
<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-4-a-DLL-Sentinel.jpg"></p>
<p>(Left for you to try.)</p>

<p>You might check your understanding by doing exercises 10.2-1, 10.2-2 and 10.2-3.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>Array Representations of Lists</h2>

<p>We generally do not need to be concerned with the topic of this section in modern programming
languages, but if you ever have to program in FORTRAN, the section shows how to store objects such
as listElement in arrays:</p>

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-5-DLL-Array.jpg">

<p>... and how to manage your own <b>free list</b> of available listElements (languages like Java
and LISP do this automatically, but (cue old fart voice) "when I was your age ..."). Here is an
array with both a DLL and a free list embedded in it:</p>

<p><img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-7-a-Allocate-Free.jpg"></p>

<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>After allocating one free cell to add 7 to the front of the list: </td>
    <td>After deleting list item 2 at array position 5: </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-7-b-Allocate-Free.jpg"> </td>
    <td><img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-7-c-Allocate-Free.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Of course, someone has to implement the memory management, and there is a large literature on
methods of <b>garbage collection</b>.</p> 

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>Binary Trees (A First Look) </h2>

<p>Trees in general and binary trees in particular are <em>hugely</em> important data structures in
computer science. There are many ways to represent them. A linked represention provides great
flexibility and is widely used. In a few weeks we'll also see how trees can be embedded in
arrays.</p>

<p>Assume that class <tt>BinaryTree</tt> has instance variable <tt>root</tt>, and it consists of
vertices of class <tt>TreeNode</tt> with instance variables <tt>parent</tt>, <tt>left</tt> and
<tt>right</tt>, as well as possibly other data.</p>

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-9-Binary-Tree.jpg"> 

<p>In a few weeks we will study methods for search, insertion and deletion in special types of tree,
<b>heaps</b> and <b>binary search trees</b>.</p>

<p><i>Do you have any thoughts on what insertion and deletion might involve, in general?</i></p>

<p><i>Exercises:</i> <br>
10.4-2: write an O(n) recursive procedure to visit (e.g., print out) the nodes of the tree. <br>
10.4-3: write an O(n) non-recursive procedure to visit the nodes of the tree. Use a stack.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>N-ary Trees </h2>

<p>We can represent n-ary trees by providing each node with a fixed number <i>n</i> child fields
(child<sub>1</sub>, child<sub>2</sub>, child<sub>3</sub> ... child<sub>n</sub>). An equivalent
approach is used for <b>b-trees,</b> which are used for efficient disk access. </p>

<p> But a fixed <i>n</i> is only viable if we can bound the number of children, and can be wasteful
of memory if many nodes do not have <i>n</i> children.</p>

<p> An alternative representation allows each TreeNode to have an arbitrary number of children while
still using O(n) space.</p>

<h3>Left-Child Right-Sibling Representation</h3>

<p>This implementation has instance variable <tt>root</tt>, but consists of vertices that are
instances of a class we'll call LCRSTreeNode with instance variables <tt>parent</tt>,
<tt>left-child</tt> and <tt>right-sibling</tt>, as well as possibly other data. (Alternatively, we
can just use TreeNode, but understand <tt>left</tt> to refer to the left-child and <tt>right</tt> to
refer to the right sibling.) </p>

<img src="Topic-04/Fig-10-10-LC-RS-Tree.jpg">

<p>A good practice problem is to write a procedure for visiting (printing out) all the
nodes of these kinds of trees.</p>

<a name="dynamicsetadt">&nbsp;</a>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2>Dynamic Set ADT</h2>

<p>Above we have been reviewing basic data structures for keeping track of objects under specific
organizational schemes (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, sequential, and hierarchical). </p>

<p>Another organizational scheme is the <b>set</b> or <b>ordered set</b>. We often need to keep
track of a set of objects, query it for membership, and possibly modify the set dynamically. Other
operations are also possible if the elements of the set are ordered.</p>

<p>These capabilities can be implemented in different ways. The Dynamic Set ADT captures the
requirements that implementations must meet. Many of the ADTs (and their implementations as data
structures and algorithms) we will study can be seen as specializations of the Dynamic Set ADT.</p>

<h3>Text's Dynamic Set ADT</h3>

<p>The introduction to Part III of the textbook, page 230, gives this specification:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>
<dl>
  
  <dt>SEARCH(S; k)</dt>
  <dd>A query that, given a set S and a key value k, returns a pointer x to an element
    in S such that x.key = k, or NIL if no such element belongs to S.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>INSERT(S; x)</dt>
    <dd>A modifying operation that augments the set S with the element pointed to by x. We usually
        assume that any attributes in element x needed by the set implementation have already been
        initialized.</dd> 
    <br>
    <dt>DELETE(S; x)</dt>
    <dd>A modifying operation that, given a pointer x to an element in the set S, removes
        x from S. (Note that this operation takes a pointer to an element x, not
        a key value.)</dd> 
    <br>
    <dt>MINIMUM(S)</dt>
    <dd>A query on a totally ordered set S that returns a pointer to the element of S
        with the smallest key.</dd> 
    <br>
    <dt>MAXIMUM(S)</dt>
    <dd>A query on a totally ordered set S that returns a pointer to the element of S
        with the largest key.</dd> 
    <br>
    <dt>SUCCESSOR(S; x)</dt>
    <dd>A query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S,
        returns a pointer to the next larger element in S, or NIL if x is the maximum
        element.</dd> 
    <br>
    <dt>PREDECESSOR(S; x)</dt>
    <dd>A query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S,
        returns a pointer to the next smaller element in S, or NIL if x is the minimum
        element.</dd> 
</dl> 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There are some issues with this specification, particularly in the use of x.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The specification seems to require that the client know about the the internal implementation
       of the set ("We usually assume that any attributes in element x needed by the set
       implementation have already been initialized").</li>
  <li> Alternatively, if the elements are client objects, the set implementation would have to know
       how to access these to get the key. </li> 
</ul>

<p>A safer specification would give INSERT and DELETE the key k rather than the element x,
hiding implementation details and reducing dependencies between client and ADT. This in turn leads
to a performance problem, dicussed below, but it can be resolved. </p>

<h3>Encapsulated Dynamic Set ADT</h3>

<p>An encapsulated version of the ADT is given as a Java interface below. It communicates
with clients primarily through keys and associated elements that only the client need
understand. </p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>

<pre>

  public interface <b>DynamicSet</b> {
  // ADT that stores and retrieves Objects according to keys of type KeyType
 
     public <b>DynamicSet</b>( ); 
     // Creates an instance of ADT DynamicSet and initializes it to the empty set. &nbsp; 
 
     public void <b>insert</b>(KeyType k; Object e); 
     // Inserts element e in the set under key k.
 
     public void <b>delete</b>(KeyType k); 
     // Given a key k, removes elements indexed by k from the set.
 
     public Object <b>search</b>(KeyType k); 
     // Finds an Object with key k and returns a pointer to it,
     // or null if not found. 
 
     // The following operations apply when there is a total ordering on KeyType &nbsp; 
 
     public Object <b>minimum</b>( ); 
     // Finds an Object that has the smallest key, and returns a pointer to it,
     // or null if the set is empty. 
 
     public Object <b>maximum</b>( ); 
     // Finds an Object that has the largest key, and returns a pointer to it,
     // or null if the set is empty.
 
     public Object <b>successor</b>(KeyType k); 
     // Finds an Object that has the next larger key in the set above k, 
     // and returns a pointer to it, or null if k is the maximum element.
 
     public Object <b>predecessor</b>(KeyType k); 
     // Finds an Object that has the next smaller key in the set below k,
     // and returns a pointer to it, or null if k is the minimum element.
 }
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>As hinted above, we may pay a cost for proper encapsulation. For example, suppose an application
must frequently pair <tt>search</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> operations to find elements we want to
remove. If <tt>search</tt> cannot communicate the location found in the underlying datastructure to
<tt>delete</tt>, then <tt>delete</tt> will have to search again to find what to operate on.</p>

<p>This inefficiency could be eliminated by abstracting the concept of a <b>position</b> in a data
structure, and passing around position objects that hide implementation details. This solution is
not discussed here as it is more of a software engineering rather than algorithm design and analysis
concern: see Goodrich &amp; Tamassia's Algorithms textbook for one approach. </p>

<h3>Alternative Dynamic Set Implementations</h3>

<p>Linked lists can be used to support a viable Dynamic Set implementation for small sets, for
example using <tt>listInsert</tt> and <tt>listSearch</tt> to implement <tt>insert</tt> and
<tt>search</tt>, respectively. </p>

<p>Future Topics will present Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees, and Red-Black Trees as alternative
implementations of DynamicSet. You will use some of these in your assignments (and often as a
working professional), so need to understand them well.</p>
