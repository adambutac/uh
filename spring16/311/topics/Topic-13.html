<p>This presentation follows the CLRS reading fairly closely, selecting out the most relevant parts
and explaining a few things in more detail. (The associated videos change the ordering somewhat: 13A
provides a conceptual introduction, leaving the activity selection example for 13B.)</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Prelude: Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming </h2>

<p>Both Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms are ways of solving <i><b>optimization
problems</b></i>: a solution is sought that optimizes (minimizes or maximizes) an <i><b>objective
function</b></i>.</p>

<p><b>Dynamic Programming:</b></p>
<ul> 
  <li>Finds solutions bottom-up (solves subproblems before solving their super-problem) </li> 
  <li>Exploits overlapping subproblems for efficiency (by reusing solutions)</li>
  <li>Can handle subproblem interdependence </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Greedy Algorithms</b> "greedily" take the choice with the most immediate gain. </p>
<ul> 
  <li>Find solutions top-down (commit to a choice, then solve sub-problems) </li>
  <li>Assume that if the objective function is optimized locally it will be optimized
globally</li>
  <li>Cannot handle interdependent subproblems </li>
</ul>
<p>For some problems, but not all, local optimization actually results in global optimization.</p> 

<p>We'll use an example to simultaneously review dynamic programming and motivate greedy algorithms,
as the two approaches are related (but distinct).</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Activity Selection Problem </h2>

<p>Suppose that <i>activities</i> require exclusive use of a common resource, and you want to
schedule as many as possible.</p>

<p>Let <i>S</i> = {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>a</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>} be a set of <i>n</i> activities.</p>

<p>Each activity <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> needs the resource during a time period starting at
<i>s<sub>i</sub></i> and finishing before <i>f<sub>i</sub></i>, i.e., during [<i>s<sub>i</sub></i>,
<i>f<sub>i</sub></i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Why not</i> [<i>s<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>f<sub>i</sub></i>]?)</p>

<p>The optimization problem is to select the largest set of non-overlapping (mutually compatible)
activities from <i>S</i>.</p>

<p>We assume that activities are sorted by finish time <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> &le;
<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> &le; ... <i>f</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub> &le; <i>f</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> (this
can be done in &Theta;(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>)). </p>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Consider these activities:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/activities.jpg">
<p>Here is a graphic representation:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/activity-timeline.jpg">

<p>Suppose we chose one of the activities that <i>start first</i>, and then look for the next
activity that starts after it is done. This could result in {<i>a</i><sub>4</sub>,
<i>a</i><sub>7</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>8</sub>}, but this solution is not optimal.</p>

<p>An optimal solution is {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>3</sub> <i>a</i><sub>6</sub>,
<i>a</i><sub>8</sub>}. (It maximizes the objective function of number of activities scheduled.)</p>

<p>Another one is {<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>5</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>7</sub>,
<i>a</i><sub>9</sub>}. (Optimal solutions are not necessarily unique.) </p>

<p>How do we find (one of) these optimal solutions? Let's consider it as a dynamic programming
problem ...</p>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>Optimal Substructure Analysis</h3>

<p>A dynamic programming analysis begins by identifying the choices to be made, and assuming that
you can make an optimal choice (without yet specifying what that choice is) that will be part of an
optimal solution.</p>

<p>It then specifies the possible subproblems that result in the most general way (to ensure that
possible components of optimal solutions are not excluded), and shows that an an optimal solution
must recursively include optimal solutions to the subproblems. (This is done by reasoning about the
value of the solutions according to the objective function.)</p>

<p>We'll approach Activity Selection similarly. I'll try to clarify the reasoning in the text
...</p> 

<p>For generality, we define the problem in a way that applies both to the original problem and
subproblems.</p>

<p>Suppose that due to prior choices we are working on a time interval from <i>i</i> to
<i>j</i>. This could be after some already-scheduled activity <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> and before some
already-scheduled event <i>a<sub>j</sub></i>, or for the original problem we can define <i>i</i> and
<i>j</i> to bound the full set of activities to be considered.</p> 

<p> Then the candidate activities to consider are those that start after <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> and
end before <i>a<sub>j</sub></i>:</p>

<img src="Topic-13/compatible-activities.jpg"><br>
<img src="Topic-13/compatible-activities-timeline.jpg">

<p>Now let's define <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i> to be an optimal solution, i.e., a maximal set of mutualy
compatible activities in <i>S<sub>ij</sub></i>. What is the structure of this solution?</p>

<p>At some point we will need to make a choice to include some activity <i>a<sub>k</sub></i> with
start time <i>s<sub>k</sub></i> and finishing by <i>f<sub>k</sub></i> in this solution. This choice
will leave two sets of compatible candidates after <i>a<sub>k</sub></i> is taken
out:</p> 
<ul>
  <li><i>S<sub>ik</sub></i> : activities that start after <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> finishes,
                             and finish before <i>a<sub>k</sub></i> starts </li>
  <li><i>S<sub>kj</sub></i> : activities that start after <i>a<sub>k</sub></i> finishes,
                             and finish before <i>a<sub>j</sub></i> starts </li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that <i>S<sub>ij</sub></i> may be a proper superset of <i>S<sub>ik</sub></i> &cup;
{<i>a<sub>k</sub></i>} &cup; <i>S<sub>kj</sub></i>, as activities incompatible with
<i>a<sub>k</sub></i> are excluded.)</p>

<p>Using the same notation as above, define the optimal solutions to these subproblems to
be:</p> 
<ul>
  <li><i>A<sub>ik</sub></i> = <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i>&cap; <i>S<sub>ik</sub></i>:
                             the optimal solution to <i>S<sub>ik</sub></i></li>
  <li><i>A<sub>kj</sub></i> = <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i> &cap; <i>S<sub>kj</sub></i>:
			     the optimal solution to <i>S<sub>kj</sub></i></li>
</ul>

<p>So the structure of an optimal solution <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i> is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i> =
    <i>A<sub>ik</sub></i> &cup; {<i>a<sub>k</sub></i>} &cup; <i>A<sub>kj</sub></i>
</blockquote>
<p>and the number of activities is: </p> 
<blockquote>
  |<i>A<sub>ij</sub></i>| = |<i>A<sub>ik</sub></i>| + 1 +  |<i>A<sub>kj</sub></i>| 
</blockquote>

<p>By the "cut and paste argument", an optimal solution <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i> for
<i>S<sub>ij</sub></i> must include the optimal solutions <i>A<sub>ik</sub></i> for
<i>S<sub>ik</sub></i> and <i>A<sub>kj</sub></i> for <i>S<sub>kj</sub></i>, because if some
suboptimal solution <i>A'<sub>ik</sub></i> were used for <i>S<sub>ik</sub></i> (or similarly
<i>A'<sub>kj</sub></i> for <i>S<sub>kj</sub></i>), where |<i>A'<sub>ik</sub></i>| &lt;
|<i>A<sub>ik</sub></i>|, we could substitute <i>A<sub>ik</sub></i> to increase the number of
activities (a contradiction to optimality). </p>

<p>Therefore the Activity Scheduling problem exhibits optimal substructure.</p>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>Recursive Solution</h3>

<p>Since the optimal solution <i>A</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> must include optimal solutions to the
subproblems for <i>S</i><sub><i>ik</i></sub> and <i>S</i><sub><i>kj</i></sub>, we could solve by
dynamic programming.</p>

<p>Let <i>c</i>[<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>] = size of optimal solution for <i>S</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub>
(<i>c</i>[<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>] has the same value as |<i>A<sub>ij</sub></i>|, but apparently we are
switching notation to indicate that this is for any optimal solution). Then </p>

<blockquote>
  <i>c</i>[<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>] = <i>c</i>[<i>i</i>, <i>k</i>] + <i>c</i>[<i>k</i>, <i>j</i>] + 1
  &nbsp; (the 1 is to count <i>a<sub>k</sub></i>).  </blockquote>
<p>We don't know which activity <i>a<sub>k</sub></i> to choose for an optimal solution, so we
could try them all:</p>
<img src="Topic-13/activity-scheduling-recurrence-16-2.jpg">
<p>This suggests a recursive algorithm that can be memoized, or we could develop an equivalent
bottom-up approach, filling in tables in either case.</p> 
<p>But it turns out we can solve this without considering multiple subproblems.</p>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>Being Greedy</h3>

<p>We are trying to optimize the number of activities. Let's be greedy!</p>
<ul> 
  <li>The more time that is left after running an activity, the more subsequent activities we can fit
      in. </li> 
  <li>If we <b>choose the first activity to <em>finish,</em></b> the most time will be left.</li> 
  <li>Since activities are sorted by finish time, we will always start with <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>. </li> 
  <li>Then we can solve the single subproblem of activity scheduling in this remaining time.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Since there is only a single subproblem, the <i>S<sub>ij</sub></i> notation, bounding the set at
both ends, is more complex than we need. We'll simplify the notation to indicate the activities that
start after <i>a<sub>k</sub></i> finishes: </p>
<blockquote>
  <i>S</i><sub>k</sub> = {<i>a<sub>i</sub></i> &in; <i>S</i> : <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> &ge;
  <i>f<sub>k</sub></i>}
</blockquote>

<p>So, after choosing <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> we just have <i>S</i><sub>1</sub> to solve (and so
on after choices in recursive subproblems). </p>

<p>By optimal substructure, <em>if</em> <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> is part of an optimal solution, then an
optimal solution to the original problem consists of <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> plus all activities in an
optimal solution to <i>S</i><sub>1</sub>. </p>

<p>But we need to prove that <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> is always part of some optimal solution (i.e., to prove
our original intuition). </p>

<p><i><b>Theorem:</b></i> If <i>S</i><sub>k</sub> is nonempty and <i>a<sub>m</sub></i> has the
earliest finish time in <i>S</i><sub>k</sub>, then <i>a<sub>m</sub></i> is included in some optimal
solution.</p>

<p><i>Proof:</i> Let <i>A<sub>k</sub></i> be an optimal solution to <i>S</i><sub>k</sub>, and let
<i>a<sub>j</sub></i> &in; <i>A<sub>k</sub></i> have the earliest finish time in
<i>A<sub>k</sub></i>. If <i>a<sub>j</sub></i> = <i>a<sub>m</sub></i> we are done. Otherwise, let
<i>A'</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = (<i>A<sub>k</sub></i> - {<i>a<sub>j</sub></i>}) &cup;
{<i>a<sub>m</sub></i>} (substitute <i>a<sub>m</sub></i> for <i>a<sub>j</sub></i>). </p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Claim:</i> Activities in <i>A'<sub>k</sub></i> are disjoint.</p>

<p><i>Proof of Claim:</i> Activities in <i>A<sub>k</sub></i> are disjoint because it was a
solution.<br>
Since <i>a<sub>j</sub></i> is the first activity in <i>A<sub>k</sub></i> to finish, and
f<sub>m</sub> &le; f<sub>j</sub> (<i>a<sub>m</sub></i> is the earliest in <i>S<sub>k</sub></i>), 
<i>a<sub>m</sub></i> cannot overlap with any other activities in  <i>A'<sub>k</sub></i>.<br>
No other changes were made to <i>A<sub>k</sub></i>, so <i>A'<sub>k</sub></i> must consist of
disjoint activities.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since |<i>A'<sub>k</sub></i>| = |<i>A<sub>k</sub></i>| we can conclude that <i>A'<sub>k</sub></i>
is also an optimal solution to <i>S</i><sub>k</sub>, and it includes <i>a<sub>m</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Therefore we don't need the full power of dynamic programming: we can just repeatedly choose the
activity that finishes first, remove any activities that are incompatible with it, and repeat on the
remaining activities until no activities remain.</p> 

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>Greedy Algorithm Solution</h3>

<p>Let the start and finish times be represented by arrays <i>s</i> and <i>f</i>, where <i>f</i> is
assumed to be sorted in monotonically increasing order.</p>

<p>Add a fictitious activity <i>a</i><sub>0</sub> with <i>f</i><sub>0</sub> = 0, so
<i>S</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>S</i> (i.e., the entire input sequence).</p>

<p>Our initial call will be RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(<i>s</i>, <i>f</i>, 0, <i>n</i>).</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/pseudocode-recursive-activity.jpg">

<p>The algorithm is &Theta;(<i>n</i>) because each activity is examined exactly once across all
calls: each recursive call starts at <i>m</i>, where the previous call left off. (Another example of
aggregate analysis.) </p>

<p>If the activities need to be sorted, the overall problem can be solved in &Theta;(<i>n</i> lg
<i>n</i>)).</p> 

<p>This algorithm is nearly tail recursive, and can easily be converted to an iterative
version:</p>  
<img src="Topic-13/pseudocode-greedy-activity.jpg">

<p>Let's trace the algorithm on this:</p>
<img src="Topic-13/activity-timeline.jpg">


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> A Closer Look at the Greedy Strategy </h2>

<p>Instead of starting with the more elaborate dynamic programming analysis, we could have gone
directly to the greedy approach.</p>

<p>Typical steps for designing a solution with the greedy strategy (and two properties that are key
to determining whether it might apply to a problem): </p> 
<ol>
  <li>Consider how we can make a greedy choice (local optimization of the
       objective function), leaving one subproblem to solve.</li> 
  <li><b>Greedy Choice Property:</b> Prove that the greedy choice is always part of some optimal 
       solution.</li>  
  <li><b>Optimal Substructure:</b> Demonstrate that an optimal solution to the problem contains
       within it optimal solutions to the subproblems.</li> 
</ol>
<p>Then we can construct an algorithm that combines the greedy choice with an optimal solution to
the remaining problem.</p>

<h3> Dynamic Programming compared to Greedy Strategy:</h3>

<p>Both require optimal substructure, but ...</p> 

<p><b>Dynamic Programming</b></p>
<ul> 
  <li>Each choice depends on knowing the optimal solutions to subproblems.</li>
  <li>Bottom-up: Solve subproblems first</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Greedy Strategy</b></p> 
<ul> 
  <li>Each choice depends only on local optimization </li>
  <li>Top-down: Make choice before solving subproblems </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: Knapsack Problems</h3>

<p>These two problems demonstrate that the two strategies do not solve the same problems. Suppose a
thief has a knapsack of fixed carrying capacity, and wants to optimize the value of what he takes.</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-2-0-1-a-knapsack-example.jpg" align="right">

<h4>0-1 knapsack problem:</h4>
<p>There are <i>n</i> items. Item <i>i</i> is worth $<i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and weighs
<i>w<sub>i</sub></i> pounds. The thief wants to take the most valuable subset of items with weight
not exceeding <i>W</i> pounds. It is called 0-1 because the thief must either not take or take each item
(they are discrete objects, like gold ingots).</p>

<p>In the example, item 1 is worth $6/pound, item 2 $5/pound and item 3 $4/pound.</p>

<p>The greedy strategy of optimizing value per unit of weight would take item 1 first.</p>

<h4>Fractional knapsack problem:</h4>
<p>The same as the 0-1 knapsack problem except that the thief <i>can take a fraction of each item</i>
(they are divisible substances, like gold powder).</p>

<p>Both have optimal substructure <i>(why?).</i></p>

<p>Only the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy choice property:</p>

<p><em>Fractional:</em> One can fill up as much of the most valuable substance by weight as one can
hold, then as much of the next most valuable substance, etc., until <i>W</i> is reached:</p>
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-2-0-1-c-knapsack-example.jpg">

<p><em>0-1:</em> A greedy strategy could result in empty space, reducing the overall dollar density
of the knapsack. After choosing item 1, the optimal solution (shown third) cannot be achieved:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-2-0-1-b-knapsack-example-reordered.jpg">

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<hr><h2> Huffman Codes </h2>

<p>We are going to see several greedy algorithms throughout the semester. The activity scheduler was
good for illustration, but is not important in practice. We should look at one important greedy
algorithm today ... </p>

<p>Huffman codes provide an efficient way to compress text, and are constructed using a greedy
algorithm. We only have time to review how this important algorithm works; see the text for
analysis.</p> 

<!-- ------------------------------------------ -->
<h3>Binary Codes </h3>

<p><b>Fixed-length binary codes</b> (e.g., ASCII) represent each character with a fixed number of
bits (a binary string of fixed length called a <b>codeword</b>).</p>

<p><b>Variable-length binary codes</b> can vary the number of bits allocated to each character. This
opens the possibility of space efficiency by using fewer bits for frequent characters.</p>

<p>Example: Suppose we want to encode documents with these characters:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-3-character-coding-problem.jpg">
<p>With a 3 bit code it would take 300,000 bits to code a file of 100,000 characters, but the
variable-length code shown requires only 224,000 bits.</p> 

<p><b>Prefix codes</b> (better named <b>prefix-free codes</b>) are codes in which no codeword is a
prefix of another.</p>

<p>For any data, it is always possible to construct a prefix code that is optimal (though not all
prefix codes are optimal, as we will see below).</p>

<p>Prefix codes also have the advantage that each character in an input file can be "consumed"
unambiguously, as the prefix cannot be confused with another code.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------ -->
<h3>Binary Tree Representation of Prefix Codes</h3>

<p>We can think of the 0 and 1 in a prefix code as directions for traversing a binary tree: 0 for
left and 1 for right. The leaves store the coded character. For example, here is the fixed-length
prefix code from the table above represented as a binary tree: </p>

<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-3-character-coding-problem.jpg" align = "right" border="1">
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-4-a-coding-tree.jpg">

<p>Consuming bits from an input file, we traverse the tree until the character is identified, and
then start over at the top of the tree for the next character.</p>

<p><i>Exercise: Decode 101100100011</i></p>

<p>But the above tree uses three bits per character: it is not optimal. It can be shown that an
optimal code is always represented by a full binary tree (every non-leaf node has two children).</p>
 
<p>For example, an optimal prefix code (from the table reproduced again here) is represented by this
tree: </p>  
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-4-b-coding-tree.jpg">
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-3-character-coding-problem.jpg" align="right" border="1">
<p><i>Exercise: Decode 10111010111</i></p>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>Huffman's Algorithm</h3>

<p>Huffman's greedy algorithm constructs optimal prefix codes called <b>Huffman Codes</b>. </p>

<p>It is given a set <i>C</i> of <i>n</i> characters, where each character has frequency
<i>c.freq</i> in the "text" to be encoded.</p>

<p>The optimality of a code is relative to a "text", which can be what we normally think of as
texts, or can be other data encoded as sequences of bits, such as images. </p>
<ul>
  <li>We can construct a generic Huffman code for a universe of texts, such as all texts in English, 
      by estimating the frequency of characters in this universe of texts.</li>
  <li>More commonly, we contruct Huffman codes optimized for particular
       documents. Then the document-specific code needs to be passed on along with the 
       compressed document.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The algorithm creates a binary tree leaf node for each character, annotated with its
frequency, and the tree nodes are then put on a min-priority queue (this is only implied in line 2
below).</p> 

<p>Then the first two subtrees on the queue (those with minimum frequency) are dequeued with
<tt>Extract-Min</tt>, merged into a single tree, annotated with the sum of their frequencies, and
this single node is re-queued.</p>

<p>This process is repeated until only one tree node remains on the queue (the root). Since a tree
is being constructed and |<i>E</i>| = |<i>V</i>|&minus;1 we can just run the loop until
<i>n</i>&minus;1 and know that there will be one node left at this point. </p>

<p>Here is the algorithm: </p>
<img src="Topic-13/pseudocode-huffman.jpg">

<h4>Informal Correctness</h4>
<p>The "greedy" aspect is the choice to merge min-frequency nodes
first, and assume that this local minimization will result in an optimal global solution.</p>

<p>Intuitively, this approach will result in an optimal solution because the lowest frequency items
will be "pushed down" deeper in the tree, and hence have longer codes; while higher frequency items
will end up nearer the root, and hence have the shortest codes.</p>

<p>Cormen et al. prove correctness with two Lemmas for the two properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Greedy choice property: there exists an optimal prefix code
       where two characters having the lowest frequency in <i>C</i> are encoded with equal length
       strings that differ only in the last bit, as they are leaf nodes. </li> 
  <li> Optimal-substructure property: if the tree constructed
       by merging two nodes is optimal it must have been constructed from an 
       optimal tree for the subproblem.</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Complexity</h4> 
<p>The initial BUILD-MIN-HEAP implied by line 2 requires O(<i>n</i>) time. <br>
The loop executes <i>n</i> times, with O(lg <i>n</i>) required for each heap operation.<br>
Thus, HUFFMAN is O(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>). </p> 

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<h3>An Example of Huffman Coding</h3>

<p>The characters are in a min priority queue by frequency:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-5-a-huffman-trace.jpg">

<p>Take out the two lowest frequency items and make a subtree that is put back on the queue as if it
is a combined character:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-5-b-huffman-trace.jpg">

<img src="Topic-13/pseudocode-huffman.jpg" align = "right">

<p>Combine the next lowest frequency characters:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-5-c-huffman-trace.jpg">

<p>Continuing, tree fragments themselves become subtrees:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-5-d-huffman-trace.jpg">

<p>Two subtrees are merged next:</p> 
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-5-e-huffman-trace.jpg">

<p>The highest frequency character gets added to the tree last, so it will have a code of length
1:</p>
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-3-character-coding-problem.jpg" align="right" border="1">
<img src="Topic-13/Fig-16-5-f-huffman-trace.jpg">

<p>One might wonder why the second most frequent character does not have a code of length 2. This
would force the other characters to be deeper in the tree, giving them excessively long codes.</p>

<hr><h2>Wrapup</h2>

<p>We will encounter several examples of greedy algorithms later in the course, including classic
algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (Topic <a href="Topic-17.html">17</a>) and shortest
paths in graphs (Topics <a href="Topic-18.html">18</a> and <a href="Topic-19.html">19</a>).</p>
