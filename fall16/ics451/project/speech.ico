Ladies and gentlemen, our freedom is under attack.

The government is trying to control the internet.

Great Brittain has passed a bill that allows them to record internet traffic, and hold the inforation for up to a year.

China literally tries to control (and I say try for good reason) their people by limiting the information available by the internet.
