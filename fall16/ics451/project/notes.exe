MODUS OPERANDI
  Convince to the reader that there is a great need for anonomizing internet traffic.
  Show the reader how TOR fills the need as a tool to anonomize the internet.

  Our arguments must be supported by facts about the TOR protocol.

    Ex. 
      ARGUMENT: Anonomizing the internet is important because: spying is unethical. 
      SOLUTION: TOR allows one to securly browse the internet by encrypting data in layers.
      SOLUTION: TOR provides anonimity by creating random chains within the TOR network.

  Perhaps we should try to focus on legitimate activites so we may build a better argument using pathos.
    Ex.
      How would you feel if you had vital information to share, but were afraid of becoming a target?
      How would you feel if my job was to watch everything you do on the internet?
      How would you feel if the internet was censored by the government?

  We can save the illicit activities for "entertainment secitons" during the presentation.

Another structure which may be more appealing might be to first state all the issues of
using normie internet vs TOR, then afterwards explain how TOR negates them.
