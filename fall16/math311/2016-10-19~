Invarient subspaces

    L: V -> V linear operator

if u subspace of V & L(u) <= u, then
    u is called invarient


1)
    L restricts to a linear map from u to U


Examples:

    U is all of V
    U is zero {0} the zero set
    U is the kernel
    U is the image of L


Invarient Subspaces of dimension 1:

    v is an eigen vector if

    L of V is a multiple of v
    L(v) = lam*v (some multiple of v)



THEORM: 

    If lam_1 lam_r are distinct eigen values for eigen vectors v1, ... , vr then v1, ... vr are lin ind.
    

PROOF: 

    a1 * v1 + ... + an * vn = 0;  <= apply L
    a1*lam1*v1 + ... + an * lamn * vn = 0; multipily with lam_r
    a1 lamr v1 + ... + ar lamr * vr = 0;
    _____________________________________________________
    a1 (lam1 - lamr)v1 + ... + ar-1 (lamr-1 -lamr) vr-1 = 0;

    eventually you get the following:

    a1(lam1-lamr)(lam1-lamr-1) ... (lam1-lam2)v1  = 0
        eigen values and vectors are not zero, so the coefficent a1 must be zero

COR: 

    L: V -> V then L cannot have more than dim(V) distinct eigen values. If there were more then there would be more eigen vectors.

DEF:
    
    If lam is ean eigenvalue of L, then Elam  = { v exisits in V | L(v) = lam v}
    is the eigenspace of lam

    dim(Elam) >= 1


    we call dim(Elam) the geometric multiplicity of lam

REMARK:

    Elam is an invarient subspace


THEORM:
    
    Over field F = complex set C, every linear map has eigen values and eigen vectors.

    if L: V -> V , dim (V) = n, L has n distinct eigen values,  then
    with respect to the basis consists of eigen values, the matrix of L is diagonal.

    
    Use the basis of the eigen vectors B

    [L] from B to B = (lam1     0       0)
                      ( 0       lam2    0)
                      ( 0       0       lam3)

EQUIVELANCE RELATION:
    
    A~B <=>  P^-1 A P = B
