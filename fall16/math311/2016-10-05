I)
    Vectorspaces, subspaces, sums

    Basis (linearly independent and spanning)   

    Coordinates

        Along the way we solved 
            system of equations, 
            matrices, 
                elementary matrices, 
                and non singularity matrices.

II)
    MAPS
        So far we have done linear maps
        L(a v_1+b v_2) = aL(v_1) + bL(v_2)
        
        All important exxample 
            V = RR^n -L-> w = RR^M
            A = M[] ^ mxn _ RR
