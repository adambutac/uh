EXAM 1 REVIEW THING

elementary matrix:
    take the identiy matrix and perform an elementary operation

note for exam:
    you forgot to reverse the order of the product...raise_volume

Thingies:
    The set spans if the something something linear equation...

    Linear independence means if the linear combination is 0 all coefficents are 0

Adding a vector to a linearly independant set that is not in the span, it is still linearly independent.

    Write down a linear combination nd set it to zero.

    So now I have to show each coefficent is zero.

Show that U is a subspace:
    It cannot be empty
    It is closed under addition and multiplication with scalars

LINEAR MAPS

aka functions, operaors, homomorphous linear functions

    Suppose V & W are vectorspaces Thru L:V -> W is linear
    for all C1 C2 in F and v1, v2 exists in V
    
    L(c1v1 + c2v2) = c1L(v1) + c2L(v2)


    example:
        V = W = C^inf(R)
        L(f) = f'

        (af + bg) = af' + bg'

        V = R^n, W=R^m
        L(v) = Av , where A exists in a matrix M^(m x n)

        L(c1v1 + c2v2) = A(c1v1 + c2v2)
