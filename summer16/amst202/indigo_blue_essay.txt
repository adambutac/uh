Large scale
clothes are very densely packed together
clothes are layered
clothes float above the ground
openness , a large room with high ceilings
items in the room are dull and somewhat faded
room is bright and well lit
blue of the clothes has a high contrast against the white walls of the room.
blue of the clothes are the only non brown/baige colors in the room.
table, chair and style of clothes are very rustic.
floating clothes forces the observer to weigh them in their mind.

Notes:
    Town: Charleston, South Carolina
    May 24-August 24, 1991
    Now displayed in Collection of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
    "Hamilton selected 45 Pinckney Street, a former auto repair shop that had previously served as a carrage house, as the site for indigo blue." - www.annhamiltonstudio.com

Large Scale:
    The scale of the installation is what I would consider to be large.
Hamilton used litteraly tons of clothes to create a massive pile of blue,
inorder to draw attention - to give a voice - to the people. The people who
labored in the background day after day relentlessly.
   "In the center of the space, a 17'x24' steel platform was piled with 14,000
pounds of blue work clothing. Built layer by layer, the pile was formed by
smoothing successive strata of pants and shirts until a volume of clothing the
size of a semi truck was formed." - www.annhamiltonstudios.com

Density:
    The clothes are layered methodically with the collars of the shirts
pointing towards what one could designate as the front of the installation. By
layering the clothes Hamilton formed a densely packed mound of blue clothes,
packed together by their own weight. Perhaps this is a symbol of how close the
working community was in the town?

Weight:
    The platform on which the clothes are layered appears to be suspsened,
most likely suppored at the center by hidden pillars. The platform is only a
few inches off the ground, however, giving the platform the illusion that it
is floating forces the viewer to try to "lift" the platform in their mind. It
begs the question "How much?". It forces the viewer to quantify in some way, 
what they are viewing.

Collars first:
    The front of the pile consists completely of collars. This could be to
emphesize the "blue collar worker" idiom, or it could signify something
completely different. This one has me slightly stumped and could possibly
reference some of her older work that I am not aware of. If anything it gives
me a sense of order, and in some ways, a sense of respect.

Surroundings:
    Indigo Blue was originally set up in a former auto repair shop which had
previously served as a carrage house. It is now displayed in the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art. The two areas are very different from eachother. The
original installation had a very rustic energy to it. It basically looked like
an old run down mill. Grayed wooden walls which felt to be on the colder side
of the color spectrum(if I remember correctly). 
    However, at what appears to be the museum, the surrounding enclosure is
given a much more modern look with bright warmer colored floors of yellow like
bamboo, and white painted walls. This gave the installation a contrast between
what was in the room and the room itself. This contrast is what brought my
attention to the actor and how they were dressed, and how they presented
themselves.

Actor:
    A lot can be said about the actor in the installation, but the main point
I want to get across right now is that they are clearly the representation of
the modern day blue collar worker. The middle class no longer has to toil for
hours bailing hay or hammering iron. With the help of our ancestors we now
live much different lives from what they had experienced. Whether it is better
or worse I couldn't say for sure, but I feel it is much better to sit at a
desk and work with my mind than it is to have to literally grind my joints to
the bone. 
    A few formal points on the actor:
        The woman in the picture I saw was wearing a white button-down shirt,
kahki pants and brown leather shoes. She depicts todays working class. She sat
quietly as she erased a book from back to front with a dab of spit at the end
of a rubber eraser.
