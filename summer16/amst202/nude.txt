Kenneth Clark said "Being naked is simply being without clothes. The nude is a
form of art."

According to Berger:

To be naked is to be ones self.

To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognised for ones self.
A nude has to be seen as an object in order to be a nude.

In my own words:
To be naked is to be who you are when there is no one (or no worry of someone) to judge you.

To be nude is to be seen naked without exposing who you are as a person to
the observer.
